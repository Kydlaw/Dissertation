\chapter{Identification of relevant entities in social media data for crisis response : a semi-supervised approach}

\section{Challenges that we face}
- Why labelisation at the token level and not at the sentence?
- Why not use a deep neural network to do this?
- Lack of a labeled data and this approach usually requires a lot of data.

\section{Scientific foundations of the approach.}
- Overall view of the approach. What are we trying to do?
- Word vectors and language models (to represent semantic)
- Clustering algorithms to identify semantic clusters
- Curse of dimensionality and dimension reduction algorithms
- Label propagation

\section{Application to token labelization in crisis response }
- Use case description
- Predicting labels of incoming messages
- Results
- Relevant metrics for our end goal
