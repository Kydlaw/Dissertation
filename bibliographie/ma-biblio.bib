  abstract = {The modern business environment tends to involve a large network of heterogeneous people, devices and organizations that engage in collaborative processes among themselves. Given the nature of this type of collaboration and the high degree of interoperability between partner Information Systems, these processes need to be agile in order to respond to changes in context, which may occur at any time during the collaborative situation. The objective is to build a Mediation Information System (MIS), in support of collaborative situations, whose architecture must be (i) built to be relevant to the collaborative situation under consideration, (ii) more easily integrated into the existing systems, and (iii) sufficiently agile, through its awareness of the environment and of process events, and through the way it reacts to events detected as being relevant. To apply agility mechanisms, it is crucial to detect the significant events that will lead to a subsequent evolution of the situation (detection step). Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is used to design the structure of the part of the system that is in charge of MIS agility. This architecture takes the events into account, manages them and, if needed, uses them to trigger the adaptation of the MIS. We have defined a means to monitor the evolution of the situation. If relevant changes are detected, and if the situation does not evolve in the expected way, an adaptation is proposed. It is concluded that the principles of detection and adaptation, combined with the responsiveness of the system (provided by the automation of transitions), and based on Event Driven Architecture principles, together provide the agility required for collaborative processes.},

  abstract     = {The management of civil security crises is the responsibility of a set of institutions and professional actors. However, the growing use of social media asserts the major role played by citizens in its implementation. From an interdisciplinary approach (information and communication sciences, computer sciences), our work proposes to study the integration of citizens' contributions to crisis management systems, especially via social media. This research contributes to the field of crisis informatics. It is presented according to four thematic axes: i) the use of social media by citizen communities in crisis situations, ii) the practices of professional actors regarding the integration of citizen contributions, iii) the opportunities to reinforce interactions between professionals and citizens in crisis management, and iv) the integration of citizen initiatives within a software tool to orchestrate the response. First, our work presents how citizens appropriate social media functionalities to meet specific needs in crisis situations. We reconsider the notion of volunteerism in crisis management and map the diversity of citizen contributions that can be perceived via social media. Secondly, we study how the practices of the actors of French departmental fire and rescue services (SDIS) integrate this emergence of citizen contributions. Although we note a certain maturity in the use of social media in crisis management units, we observe certain reticence that hinders their adoption. When it comes to integrating citizen initiatives into response operations, SDIS professionals are generally reluctant to involve citizens in their rescue missions. However, the local level seems more appropriate for the involvement of volunteers. Thirdly, our research presents areas of work and reflection to support the civil security institutions in a better integration of citizens' contributions. It brings theoretical considerations on the collaborative aspects of interactions between professionals and citizens. Fourthly, our work proposes to model the concept of citizen initiative, and to set up orchestration modes for their integration within the R-IO Suite software. Through a case study implemented in the software, we demonstrate the possibilities for a crisis management unit to lead a crisis response involving both professional and citizen actors.},

The obtained framework is also compared with a simple vision of collaborative networks (the information / function / process interweaving) to identify some requirements and expectations for collaborative networks in crisis management context.

Their counterparts in profit-making organizations have a lot to learn from them in this domain. Volatility of demand, imbalance between supply and demand and disruptions are all factors that affect commercial supply chains and call for a high level of agility. The aims of this paper are twofold: first, to clearly define the concept of supply chain agility, and second, to build a model for assessing the level of agility of a supply chain. Design/methodology/approach \textendash{} Three approaches are used in this research: literature review, case study and symbolic modeling. Findings \textendash{} The paper developed first, a framework for defining supply chain agility and second, a model for assessing and improving the capabilities of humanitarian and commercial supply chains in terms of agility, based on an analysis of humanitarian approaches. Research limitations/implications \textendash{} The model has been developed thanks to inputs from humanitarian practitioners and feedbacks from academics. The practical application to various humanitarian relief operations and commercial supply chains is yet to be done. Originality/value \textendash{} This paper contributes significantly to clarifying the notion of supply chain agility. It also provides a consistent, robust and reproducible method of assessing supply chain agility, which seems appropriate for both humanitarian and business sectors. Finally, it is complementary to existant research on humanitarian logistics. It shows that though humanitarian professionals have a lot to learn from the private sector, the reverse is also true.},

Situation awareness is presented as a predominant concern in system operation, based on a descriptive view of decision making. The relationship between situation awareness and numerous individual and environmental factors is explored. Among these factors, attention and working memory are presented as critical factors limiting operators from acquiring and interpreting information from the environment to form situation awareness, and mental models and goal-directed behavior are hypothesized as important mechanisms for overcoming these limits. The impact of design features, workload, stress, system complexity, and automation on operator situation awareness is addressed, and a taxonomy of errors in situation awareness is introduced, based on the model presented. The model is used to generate design implications for enhancing operator situation awareness and future directions for situation awareness research.},

Les parties-prenantes sont nombreuses, autonomes et h\'et\'erog\`enes, la coexistence de plans d'urgence engendre des contradictions et des effets en cascade se nourrissent des interconnexions entre r\'eseaux. Ces constats arrivent alors que les donn\'ees disponibles sur les r\'eseaux informatiques ne cessent de se multiplier. Elles sont, par exemple, \'emises par des capteurs de mesures, sur des r\'eseaux sociaux, ou par des b\'en\'evoles.

  abstract   = {An information system (IS) is a formal, sociotechnical, organizational system designed to collect, process, store, and distribute information. From a sociotechnical perspective, information systems are composed by four components: task, people, structure (or roles), and technology. Information systems can be defined as an integration of components for collection, storage and processing of data of which the data is used to provide information, contribute to knowledge as well as digital products that facilitate decision making.A computer information system is a system composed of people and computers that processes or interprets information. The term is also sometimes used to simply refer to a computer system with software installed. Information Systems is an academic study of systems with a specific reference to information and the complementary networks of hardware and software that people and organizations use to collect, filter, process, create and also distribute data. An emphasis is placed on an information system having a definitive boundary, users, processors, storage, inputs, outputs and the aforementioned communication networks.In many organizations, the department or unit responsible for information systems and data processing is known as "Information Services".Any specific information system aims to support operations, management and decision-making. An information system is the information and communication technology (ICT) that an organization uses, and also the way in which people interact with this technology in support of business processes.Some authors make a clear distinction between information systems, computer systems, and business processes. Information systems typically include an ICT component but are not purely concerned with ICT, focusing instead on the end-use of information technology. Information systems are also different from business processes. Information systems help to control the performance of business processes.Alter argues for advantages of viewing an information system as a special type of work system. A work system is a system in which humans or machines perform processes and activities using resources to produce specific products or services for customers. An information system is a work system whose activities are devoted to capturing, transmitting, storing, retrieving, manipulating and displaying information.As such, information systems inter-relate with data systems on the one hand and activity systems on the other. An information system is a form of communication system in which data represent and are processed as a form of social memory. An information system can also be considered a semi-formal language which supports human decision making and action. Information systems are the primary focus of study for organizational informatics.},

  abstract = {Crises (such as a plane accident) require fast and effective responses. In order to respond effectively, actors need to be aware of the situation. Actors who are experts in different fields also need to interact and cooperate with one another. The focus of this study is on theoretical study and model development in which cases are used as material. As a result of the research, we have identified common features in four emergency response cases. We present a model that explains how the actors comprehend the situation and how they interact during the operations. We offer ideas for developing the information systems \textendash{} often called situation pictures or common operational pictures \textendash{} that are used in the emergency situations as a means of supporting situational awareness, interaction and decision-making. The results highlight especially the importance of a narrative in situational awareness creation and sharing processes. The results enable actors to develop the processes and the tools to better support emergency response operations.},

The differences in the factor scores between those organizations with a crisis management unit (CMU) and those without one are statistically significant. The paper suggests that organizations would do well to consider forming dual crisis portfolios: one made up of a set of preventative actions drawn from the action clusters and another composed of a set of crises drawn from the crisis clusters. In this way, organizations could not only begin to insure themselves with minimal coverage across a broad family of crises, but they could also add a significant component of needed rationalization to their CM programs. The paper discusses the broad implications of the results for an emerging general theory of CM.},

Situation awareness, and the design of systems to support it, has been a focus in recent emergency management research. In this paper, we introduce two interventions to the core processes of information processing and information sharing in emergency response teams to analyze their effect on the teams' situation awareness: (1) we enrich raw incoming information by adding a summary of the information received, and (2) we channel all incoming information to a central coordinator who then decides upon further distribution within the team. The effect of both interventions is investigated through a controlled experiment with experienced professional responders. Our results show distinctly different effects for information enrichment and centralization, both for the teams and for the coordinators within the team. While the interaction effects of both conditions cannot be discerned, it is apparent that processing non-enriched information and non-centralized information sharing leads to a worse overall team situation awareness. Our work suggests several implications for the design of emergency response management information systems.},

A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

We begin by describing the concept of Social Media, and discuss how it differs from related concepts such as Web 2.0 and User Generated Content. Based on this definition, we then provide a classification of Social Media which groups applications currently subsumed under the generalized term into more specific categories by characteristic: collaborative projects, blogs, content communities, social networking sites, virtual game worlds, and virtual social worlds. Finally, we present 10 pieces of advice for companies which decide to utilize Social Media.},

Health communicators need more information on misinformation and the social media environment during a fear-inducing disease outbreak to improve communication practices. The purpose of this study was to describe the content of Ebola-related tweets with a specific focus on misinformation, political content, health related content, risk framing, and rumors. We examined tweets from a random 1\% sample of all tweets published September 30th - October 30th, 2014, filtered for English-language tweets mentioning ``Ebola'' in the content or hashtag, that had at least 1 retweet (N = 72,775 tweets). A randomly selected subset of 3639 (5\%) tweets were evaluated for inclusion. We analyzed the 3113 tweets that meet inclusion criteria using public health trained human coders to assess tweet characteristics (joke, opinion, discord), veracity (true, false, partially false), political context, risk frame, health context, Ebola specific messages, and rumors. We assessed the proportion of tweets with specific content using descriptive statistics and chi-squared tests. Of non-joke tweets, 10\% of Ebola-related tweets contained false or partially false information. Twenty-five percent were related to politics, 28\% contained content that provoked reader response or promoted discord, 42\% contained risk elevating messages and 72\% were related to health. The most frequent rumor mentioned focused on government conspiracy. When comparing tweets with true information to tweets with misinformation, a greater percentage of tweets with misinformation were political in nature (36\% vs 15\%) and contained discord-inducing statements (45\% vs 10\%). Discord-inducing statements and political messages were both significantly more common in tweets containing misinformation compared with those without(p {$<$} 0.001). Results highlight the importance of anticipating politicization of disease outbreaks, and the need for policy makers and social media companies to build partnerships and develop response frameworks in advance of an event. While each public health event is different, our findings provide insight into the possible social media environment during a future epidemic and could help optimize potential public health communication strategies.},

Boston starting chains reach the target person with fewer intermediaries than those starting in Nebraska; subpopulations in the Nebraska group do not differ among themselves.

In this work, we developed models for automated verification of rumors (unverified information) that propagate through Twitter. To predict the veracity of rumors, we identified salient features of rumors by examining three aspects of information spread: linguistic style used to express rumors, characteristics of people involved in propagating information, and network propagation dynamics. The predicted veracity of a time series of these features extracted from a rumor (a collection of tweets) is generated using Hidden Markov Models. The verification algorithm was trained and tested on 209 rumors representing 938,806 tweets collected from real-world events, including the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, the 2014 Ferguson unrest, and the 2014 Ebola epidemic, and many other rumors about various real-world events reported on popular websites that document public rumors. The algorithm was able to correctly predict the veracity of 75\% of the rumors faster than any other public source, including journalists and law enforcement officials. The ability to track rumors and predict their outcomes may have practical applications for news consumers, financial markets, journalists, and emergency services, and more generally to help minimize the impact of false information on Twitter.},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks `rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them `small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

Messages are posted by citizens or public officials. To understand the effectiveness of these messages, we examined the content of geo-located Twitter messages ("tweets") sent during the Moore, Oklahoma tornado of May 20th, 2013 (+/-1day) to explore the spatial and temporal relationships of real-time reactions of the general public. We found a clear transition of topics during each stage of the tornado event. Twitter was useful for posting and retrieving updates, reconstructing the sequence of events as well as capturing people's reactions leading up to, during and after the tornado. A long-term goal for the research reported here is to provide insights to forecasters and emergency response personnel concerning the impact of warnings and other advisory messages.},

  abstract  = {In times of a disaster, the information available on social media can be useful for several humanitarian tasks as disseminating messages on social media is quick and easily accessible. Disaster damage assessment is inherently multi-modal, yet most existing work on damage identification has focused solely on building generic classification models that rely exclusively on text or image analysis of online social media sessions (e.g., posts). Despite their empirical success, these efforts ignore the multi-modal information manifested in social media data. Conventionally, when information from various modalities is presented together, it often exhibits complementary insights about the application domain and facilitates better learning performance. In this work, we present Crisis-DIAS, a multi-modal sequential damage identification, and severity detection system. We aim to support disaster management and aid in planning by analyzing and exploiting the impact of linguistic cues on a unimodal visual system. Through extensive qualitative, quantitative and theoretical analysis on a real-world multi-modal social media dataset, we show that the Crisis-DIAS framework is superior to the state-of-the-art damage assessment models in terms of bias, responsiveness, computational efficiency, and assessment performance.

Research studies have revealed the usefulness of the data available on Twitter for several disaster response tasks. However, making sense of social media data is a challenging task due to several reasons such as limitations of available tools to analyse high-volume and high-velocity data streams, dealing with information overload, among others. To eliminate such limitations, in this work, we first show that textual and imagery content on social media provide complementary information useful to improve situational awareness. We then explore ways in which various Artificial Intelligence techniques from Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision fields can exploit such complementary information generated during disaster events. Finally, we propose a methodological approach that combines several computational techniques effectively in a unified framework to help humanitarian organisations in their relief efforts. We conduct extensive experiments using textual and imagery content from millions of tweets posted during the three major disaster events in the 2017 Atlantic Hurricane season.

  abstract  = {Social sensing is based on the idea that communities or groups of people can provide a set of information similar to those obtainable from a sensor network. Emergency management is a candidate field of application for social sensing. In this work we describe the design, implementation and deployment of a decision support system for the detection and the damage assessment of earthquakes in Italy. Our system exploits the messages shared in real-time on Twitter, one of the most popular social networks in the world. Data mining and natural language processing techniques are employed to select meaningful and comprehensive sets of tweets. We then apply a burst detection algorithm in order to promptly identify outbreaking seismic events. Detected events are automatically broadcasted by our system via a dedicated Twitter account and by email notifications. In addition, we mine the content of the messages associated to an event to discover knowledge on its consequences. Finally we compare our results with official data provided by the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV), the authority responsible for monitoring seismic events in Italy. The INGV network detects shaking levels produced by the earthquake, but can only model the damage scenario by using empirical relationships. This scenario can be greatly improved with direct information site by site. Results show that the system has a great ability to detect events of a magnitude in the region of 3.5, with relatively low occurrences of false positives. Earthquake detection mostly occurs within seconds of the event and far earlier than the notifications shared by INGV or by other official channels. Thus, we are able to alert interested parties promptly. Information discovered by our system can be extremely useful to all the government agencies interested in mitigating the impact of earthquakes, as well as the news agencies looking for fresh information to publish. \textcopyright{} 2014 ACM.},

This paper reports the experience we gained from developing and using a web-enabled system for the online detection and monitoring of unpredictable events such as earthquakes and floods. The system captures selected message streams from Twitter and offers decision support functionalities for acquiring situational awareness from textual content and for quantifying the impact of disasters. The software architecture of the system is described and the approaches adopted for messages filtering, emergency detection and emergency monitoring are discussed. For each module, the results of real-world experiments are reported. The modular design makes the system easy configurable and allowed us to conduct experiments on different crises, including Emilia earthquake in 2012 and Genoa flood in 2014. Finally, some possible functionalities relying on the analysis of multimedia information are introduced. \textcopyright{} 2015 IEEE.},

Social networks play therefore a fundamental role in the development of decision support systems that could help both government and citizens. From user-generated contents, the information about an occurring emergency could be acquired and exploited to understand the critical event and its evolution over time. On the other side, the social interactions among users can be exploited as a dissemination gate to make people informed. In this paper, we present a decision support system for earthquake management based on machine learning and natural language processing to effectively extract and organize knowledge from online social media data. The proposed system, on a real Twitter dataset, has shown significant results for identifying messages related to (real) earthquakes and critical tremors, highlighting those posts provided by spontaneous users and containing any actionable knowledge about damages, magnitude, location and time references. \textcopyright{} 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

ATHENA recognizes that citizens are currently under-utilized in crises and that they are often willing to engage in the response effort. Social media provides a robust platform for this interaction. Due to the volume and fast paced nature of the incoming data streams, the challenges for ATHENA system are how to integrate and process this data and then how to transform it into intelligence to be used by law enforcement agencies and the public alike.

  abstract  = {Social media offer a real-time, unfiltered view of how disasters affect communities. Crisis response, disaster mental health, and-more broadly-public health can benefit from automated analysis of the public's mental state as exhibited on social media. Our focus is on Twitter data from a community that lost members in a mass shooting and another community-geographically removed from the shooting- that was indirectly exposed. We show that a common approach for understanding emotional response in text: Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) can be substantially improved using machine learning. Starting with tweets flagged by LIWC as containing content related to the issue of death, we devise a categorization scheme for death-related tweets to induce automatic text classification of such content. This improved methodology reveals striking differences in the magnitude and duration of increases in death-related talk between these communities. It also detects subtle shifts in the nature of death-related talk. Our results offer lessons for gauging public response and for developing interventions in the wake of a tragedy.

  abstract  = {Social media are an emerging new paradigm in interdisciplinary research in crisis informatics. They bring many opportunities as well as challenges to all fields of application and research involved in the project of using social media content for an improved disaster management. Using the Central European flooding 2013 as our case study, we optimize and apply methods from the field of natural language processing and unsupervised machine learning to investigate the thematic and temporal structure of German social media communication. By means of topic model analysis, we will investigate which kind of content was shared on social media during the event. On this basis, we will, furthermore, investigate the development of topics over time and apply temporal clustering techniques to automatically identify different characteristic phases of communication. From the results, we, first, want to reveal properties of social media content and show what potential social media have for improving disaster management in Germany. Second, we will be concerned with the methodological issue of finding and adapting natural language processing methods that are suitable for analysing social media data in order to obtain information relevant for disaster management. With respect to the first, application-oriented focal point, our study reveals high potential of social media content in the factual, organizational and psychological dimension of the disaster and during all stages of the disaster management life cycle. Interestingly, there appear to be systematic differences in thematic profile between the different platforms Facebook and Twitter and between different stages of the event. In context of our methodological investigation, we claim that if topic model analysis is combined with appropriate optimization techniques, it shows high applicability for thematic and temporal social media analysis in disaster management.

Next, we study two significant challenges in its design: (1) identifying which elements must be labeled by humans, and (2) determining when to ask for such annotations to be done. The first challenge is selecting the items to be labeled by crowd sourcing workers to maximize the productivity of their work. The second challenge is to schedule the work in order to reliably maintain high classification accuracy over time.

Since data gathered from these sites regarding a product/brand are up-to-date and are mostly supplied voluntarily, it tends to be more realistic, massive and reflects the general public opinion. Its analysis on real time can lead to accurate insights and responding to the results sooner is undoubtedly advantageous than responding later.

  abstract  = {Big data created by social media and mobile networks provide an exceptional opportunity to mine valuable insights from them. This information is harnessed by business entities to measure the level of customer satisfaction but its application in disaster response is still in its inflection point. Social networks are increasingly used for emergency communications and help related requests. During disaster situations, such emergency requests need to be mined from the pool of big data for providing timely help. Though government organizations and emergency responders work together through their respective national disaster response framework, the sentiment of the affected people during and after the disaster determines the success of the disaster response and recovery process. In this paper, we propose a big data driven approach for disaster response through sentiment analysis. The proposed model collects disaster data from social networks and categorize them according to the needs of the affected people. The categorized disaster data are classified through machine learning algorithm for analyzing the sentiment of the people. Various features like, parts of speech and lexicon are analyzed to identify the best classification strategy for disaster data. The results show that lexicon based approach is suitable for analyzing the needs of the people during disaster. The practical implication of the proposed methodology is the real-time categorization and classification of social media big data for disaster response and recovery. This analysis helps the emergency responders and rescue personnel to develop better strategies for effective information management of the rapidly changing disaster environment. \textcopyright{} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

With the World Wide Web having evolved from a small read-only text collection to a large-scale collection of socially created data accessible both to machines and humans alike, with the advent of social media and ubiquitous mobile applications, new sources of information are available. Currently, that potentially valuable information remains mostly unused by the command staff, mainly because the sheer amount of information cannot be handled efficiently. In this paper, we show an approach for turning massive amounts of unstructured citizen-generated content into relevant information supporting the command staff in making better informed decisions. We leverage Linked Open Data and crowdsourcing for processing data from social media, and we show how the combination of human intelligence in the crowd and automatic approaches for enhancing the situational picture with Linked Open Data will lead to a Web 3.0 approach for more efficient information handling in crisis management. \textcopyright{} 2012 ISCRAM.},

The recent advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT) and the evolution in big data analytics (BDA) technologies have provided an open opportunity to develop highly needed disaster resilient smart city environments. In this paper, we propose and discuss the novel reference architecture and philosophy of a disaster resilient smart city (DRSC) through the integration of the IoT and BDA technologies. The proposed architecture offers a generic solution for disaster management activities in smart city incentives. A combination of the Hadoop Ecosystem and Spark are reviewed to develop an efficient DRSC environment that supports both real-time and offline analysis. The implementation model of the environment consists of data harvesting, data aggregation, data pre-processing, and big data analytics and service platform. A variety of datasets (i.e., smart buildings, city pollution, traffic simulator, and twitter) are utilized for the validation and evaluation of the system to detect and generate alerts for a fire in a building, pollution level in the city, emergency evacuation path, and the collection of information about natural disasters (i.e., earthquakes and tsunamis). The evaluation of the system efficiency is measured in terms of processing time and throughput that demonstrates the performance superiority of the proposed architecture. Moreover, the key challenges faced are identified and briefly discussed. \textcopyright{} 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {Analyzing social streams is important for many applications, such as crisis management. However, the considerable diversity, increasing volume, and high dynamics of social streams of large events continue to be significant challenges that must be overcome to ensure effective exploration. We propose a novel framework by which to handle complex social streams on a budget PC. This framework features two components: 1) an online method to detect important time periods (i.e., subevents), and 2) a tailored GPU-assisted Self-Organizing Map (SOM) method, which clusters the tweets of subevents stably and efficiently. Based on the framework, we present StreamExplorer to facilitate the visual analysis, tracking, and comparison of a social stream at three levels. At a macroscopic level, StreamExplorer uses a new glyph-based timeline visualization, which presents a quick multi-faceted overview of the ebb and flow of a social stream. At a mesoscopic level, a map visualization is employed to visually summarize the social stream from either a topical or geographical aspect. At a microscopic level, users can employ interactive lenses to visually examine and explore the social stream from different perspectives. Two case studies and a task-based evaluation are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of StreamExplorer. \textcopyright{} 1995-2012 IEEE.},
