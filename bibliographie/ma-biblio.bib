  abstract = {The modern business environment tends to involve a large network of heterogeneous people, devices and organizations that engage in collaborative processes among themselves. Given the nature of this type of collaboration and the high degree of interoperability between partner Information Systems, these processes need to be agile in order to respond to changes in context, which may occur at any time during the collaborative situation. The objective is to build a Mediation Information System (MIS), in support of collaborative situations, whose architecture must be (i) built to be relevant to the collaborative situation under consideration, (ii) more easily integrated into the existing systems, and (iii) sufficiently agile, through its awareness of the environment and of process events, and through the way it reacts to events detected as being relevant. To apply agility mechanisms, it is crucial to detect the significant events that will lead to a subsequent evolution of the situation (detection step). Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is used to design the structure of the part of the system that is in charge of MIS agility. This architecture takes the events into account, manages them and, if needed, uses them to trigger the adaptation of the MIS. We have defined a means to monitor the evolution of the situation. If relevant changes are detected, and if the situation does not evolve in the expected way, an adaptation is proposed. It is concluded that the principles of detection and adaptation, combined with the responsiveness of the system (provided by the automation of transitions), and based on Event Driven Architecture principles, together provide the agility required for collaborative processes.},

  abstract     = {The management of civil security crises is the responsibility of a set of institutions and professional actors. However, the growing use of social media asserts the major role played by citizens in its implementation. From an interdisciplinary approach (information and communication sciences, computer sciences), our work proposes to study the integration of citizens' contributions to crisis management systems, especially via social media. This research contributes to the field of crisis informatics. It is presented according to four thematic axes: i) the use of social media by citizen communities in crisis situations, ii) the practices of professional actors regarding the integration of citizen contributions, iii) the opportunities to reinforce interactions between professionals and citizens in crisis management, and iv) the integration of citizen initiatives within a software tool to orchestrate the response. First, our work presents how citizens appropriate social media functionalities to meet specific needs in crisis situations. We reconsider the notion of volunteerism in crisis management and map the diversity of citizen contributions that can be perceived via social media. Secondly, we study how the practices of the actors of French departmental fire and rescue services (SDIS) integrate this emergence of citizen contributions. Although we note a certain maturity in the use of social media in crisis management units, we observe certain reticence that hinders their adoption. When it comes to integrating citizen initiatives into response operations, SDIS professionals are generally reluctant to involve citizens in their rescue missions. However, the local level seems more appropriate for the involvement of volunteers. Thirdly, our research presents areas of work and reflection to support the civil security institutions in a better integration of citizens' contributions. It brings theoretical considerations on the collaborative aspects of interactions between professionals and citizens. Fourthly, our work proposes to model the concept of citizen initiative, and to set up orchestration modes for their integration within the R-IO Suite software. Through a case study implemented in the software, we demonstrate the possibilities for a crisis management unit to lead a crisis response involving both professional and citizen actors.},

The obtained framework is also compared with a simple vision of collaborative networks (the information / function / process interweaving) to identify some requirements and expectations for collaborative networks in crisis management context.

Their counterparts in profit-making organizations have a lot to learn from them in this domain. Volatility of demand, imbalance between supply and demand and disruptions are all factors that affect commercial supply chains and call for a high level of agility. The aims of this paper are twofold: first, to clearly define the concept of supply chain agility, and second, to build a model for assessing the level of agility of a supply chain. Design/methodology/approach \textendash{} Three approaches are used in this research: literature review, case study and symbolic modeling. Findings \textendash{} The paper developed first, a framework for defining supply chain agility and second, a model for assessing and improving the capabilities of humanitarian and commercial supply chains in terms of agility, based on an analysis of humanitarian approaches. Research limitations/implications \textendash{} The model has been developed thanks to inputs from humanitarian practitioners and feedbacks from academics. The practical application to various humanitarian relief operations and commercial supply chains is yet to be done. Originality/value \textendash{} This paper contributes significantly to clarifying the notion of supply chain agility. It also provides a consistent, robust and reproducible method of assessing supply chain agility, which seems appropriate for both humanitarian and business sectors. Finally, it is complementary to existant research on humanitarian logistics. It shows that though humanitarian professionals have a lot to learn from the private sector, the reverse is also true.},

Les parties-prenantes sont nombreuses, autonomes et h\'et\'erog\`enes, la coexistence de plans d'urgence engendre des contradictions et des effets en cascade se nourrissent des interconnexions entre r\'eseaux. Ces constats arrivent alors que les donn\'ees disponibles sur les r\'eseaux informatiques ne cessent de se multiplier. Elles sont, par exemple, \'emises par des capteurs de mesures, sur des r\'eseaux sociaux, ou par des b\'en\'evoles.

  abstract   = {An information system (IS) is a formal, sociotechnical, organizational system designed to collect, process, store, and distribute information. From a sociotechnical perspective, information systems are composed by four components: task, people, structure (or roles), and technology. Information systems can be defined as an integration of components for collection, storage and processing of data of which the data is used to provide information, contribute to knowledge as well as digital products that facilitate decision making.A computer information system is a system composed of people and computers that processes or interprets information. The term is also sometimes used to simply refer to a computer system with software installed. Information Systems is an academic study of systems with a specific reference to information and the complementary networks of hardware and software that people and organizations use to collect, filter, process, create and also distribute data. An emphasis is placed on an information system having a definitive boundary, users, processors, storage, inputs, outputs and the aforementioned communication networks.In many organizations, the department or unit responsible for information systems and data processing is known as "Information Services".Any specific information system aims to support operations, management and decision-making. An information system is the information and communication technology (ICT) that an organization uses, and also the way in which people interact with this technology in support of business processes.Some authors make a clear distinction between information systems, computer systems, and business processes. Information systems typically include an ICT component but are not purely concerned with ICT, focusing instead on the end-use of information technology. Information systems are also different from business processes. Information systems help to control the performance of business processes.Alter argues for advantages of viewing an information system as a special type of work system. A work system is a system in which humans or machines perform processes and activities using resources to produce specific products or services for customers. An information system is a work system whose activities are devoted to capturing, transmitting, storing, retrieving, manipulating and displaying information.As such, information systems inter-relate with data systems on the one hand and activity systems on the other. An information system is a form of communication system in which data represent and are processed as a form of social memory. An information system can also be considered a semi-formal language which supports human decision making and action. Information systems are the primary focus of study for organizational informatics.},

  abstract = {Crises (such as a plane accident) require fast and effective responses. In order to respond effectively, actors need to be aware of the situation. Actors who are experts in different fields also need to interact and cooperate with one another. The focus of this study is on theoretical study and model development in which cases are used as material. As a result of the research, we have identified common features in four emergency response cases. We present a model that explains how the actors comprehend the situation and how they interact during the operations. We offer ideas for developing the information systems \textendash{} often called situation pictures or common operational pictures \textendash{} that are used in the emergency situations as a means of supporting situational awareness, interaction and decision-making. The results highlight especially the importance of a narrative in situational awareness creation and sharing processes. The results enable actors to develop the processes and the tools to better support emergency response operations.},

The differences in the factor scores between those organizations with a crisis management unit (CMU) and those without one are statistically significant. The paper suggests that organizations would do well to consider forming dual crisis portfolios: one made up of a set of preventative actions drawn from the action clusters and another composed of a set of crises drawn from the crisis clusters. In this way, organizations could not only begin to insure themselves with minimal coverage across a broad family of crises, but they could also add a significant component of needed rationalization to their CM programs. The paper discusses the broad implications of the results for an emerging general theory of CM.},

  abstract   = {In responding to an emergency, the actions of emergency response teams critically depend upon the situation awareness the team members have acquired. Situation awareness, and the design of systems to support it, has been a focus in recent emergency management research. In this paper, we introduce two interventions to the core processes of information processing and information sharing in emergency response teams to analyze their effect on the teams' situation awareness: (1) we enrich raw incoming information by adding a summary of the information received, and (2) we channel all incoming information to a central coordinator who then decides upon further distribution within the team. The effect of both interventions is investigated through a controlled experiment with experienced professional responders. Our results show distinctly different effects for information enrichment and centralization, both for the teams and for the coordinators within the team. While the interaction effects of both conditions cannot be discerned, it is apparent that processing non-enriched information and non-centralized information sharing leads to a worse overall team situation awareness. Our work suggests several implications for the design of emergency response management information systems.},

A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

We begin by describing the concept of Social Media, and discuss how it differs from related concepts such as Web 2.0 and User Generated Content. Based on this definition, we then provide a classification of Social Media which groups applications currently subsumed under the generalized term into more specific categories by characteristic: collaborative projects, blogs, content communities, social networking sites, virtual game worlds, and virtual social worlds. Finally, we present 10 pieces of advice for companies which decide to utilize Social Media.},

  abstract   = {The Ebola communication crisis of 2014 generated widespread fear and attention among Western news media, social media users, and members of the United States (US) public. Health communicators need more information on misinformation and the social media environment during a fear-inducing disease outbreak to improve communication practices. The purpose of this study was to describe the content of Ebola-related tweets with a specific focus on misinformation, political content, health related content, risk framing, and rumors. We examined tweets from a random 1\% sample of all tweets published September 30th - October 30th, 2014, filtered for English-language tweets mentioning ``Ebola'' in the content or hashtag, that had at least 1 retweet (N = 72,775 tweets). A randomly selected subset of 3639 (5\%) tweets were evaluated for inclusion. We analyzed the 3113 tweets that meet inclusion criteria using public health trained human coders to assess tweet characteristics (joke, opinion, discord), veracity (true, false, partially false), political context, risk frame, health context, Ebola specific messages, and rumors. We assessed the proportion of tweets with specific content using descriptive statistics and chi-squared tests. Of non-joke tweets, 10\% of Ebola-related tweets contained false or partially false information. Twenty-five percent were related to politics, 28\% contained content that provoked reader response or promoted discord, 42\% contained risk elevating messages and 72\% were related to health. The most frequent rumor mentioned focused on government conspiracy. When comparing tweets with true information to tweets with misinformation, a greater percentage of tweets with misinformation were political in nature (36\% vs 15\%) and contained discord-inducing statements (45\% vs 10\%). Discord-inducing statements and political messages were both significantly more common in tweets containing misinformation compared with those without(p {$<$} 0.001). Results highlight the importance of anticipating politicization of disease outbreaks, and the need for policy makers and social media companies to build partnerships and develop response frameworks in advance of an event. While each public health event is different, our findings provide insight into the possible social media environment during a future epidemic and could help optimize potential public health communication strategies.},

Boston starting chains reach the target person with fewer intermediaries than those starting in Nebraska; subpopulations in the Nebraska group do not differ among themselves. The funneling of chains through sociometric "stars" is noted, with 48 per cent of the chains passing through three persons before reaching the target. Applications of the method to studies of large scale social structure are discussed.}

In this work, we developed models for automated verification of rumors (unverified information) that propagate through Twitter. To predict the veracity of rumors, we identified salient features of rumors by examining three aspects of information spread: linguistic style used to express rumors, characteristics of people involved in propagating information, and network propagation dynamics. The predicted veracity of a time series of these features extracted from a rumor (a collection of tweets) is generated using Hidden Markov Models. The verification algorithm was trained and tested on 209 rumors representing 938,806 tweets collected from real-world events, including the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, the 2014 Ferguson unrest, and the 2014 Ebola epidemic, and many other rumors about various real-world events reported on popular websites that document public rumors. The algorithm was able to correctly predict the veracity of 75\% of the rumors faster than any other public source, including journalists and law enforcement officials. The ability to track rumors and predict their outcomes may have practical applications for news consumers, financial markets, journalists, and emergency services, and more generally to help minimize the impact of false information on Twitter.},

  abstract   = {Networks of coupled dynamical systems have been used to model biological oscillators1,2,3,4, Josephson junction arrays5,6, excitable media7, neural networks8,9,10, spatial games11, genetic control networks12 and many other self-organizing systems. Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks `rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them `small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

To understand the effectiveness of these messages, we examined the content of geo-located Twitter messages ("tweets") sent during the Moore, Oklahoma tornado of May 20th, 2013 (+/-1day) to explore the spatial and temporal relationships of real-time reactions of the general public. We found a clear transition of topics during each stage of the tornado event. Twitter was useful for posting and retrieving updates, reconstructing the sequence of events as well as capturing people's reactions leading up to, during and after the tornado. A long-term goal for the research reported here is to provide insights to forecasters and emergency response personnel concerning the impact of warnings and other advisory messages.},

  abstract  = {In times of a disaster, the information available on social media can be useful for several humanitarian tasks as disseminating messages on social media is quick and easily accessible. Disaster damage assessment is inherently multi-modal, yet most existing work on damage identification has focused solely on building generic classification models that rely exclusively on text or image analysis of online social media sessions (e.g., posts). Despite their empirical success, these efforts ignore the multi-modal information manifested in social media data. Conventionally, when information from various modalities is presented together, it often exhibits complementary insights about the application domain and facilitates better learning performance. In this work, we present Crisis-DIAS, a multi-modal sequential damage identification, and severity detection system. We aim to support disaster management and aid in planning by analyzing and exploiting the impact of linguistic cues on a unimodal visual system. Through extensive qualitative, quantitative and theoretical analysis on a real-world multi-modal social media dataset, we show that the Crisis-DIAS framework is superior to the state-of-the-art damage assessment models in terms of bias, responsiveness, computational efficiency, and assessment performance.

To eliminate such limitations, in this work, we first show that textual and imagery content on social media provide complementary information useful to improve situational awareness. We then explore ways in which various Artificial Intelligence techniques from Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision fields can exploit such complementary information generated during disaster events. Finally, we propose a methodological approach that combines several computational techniques effectively in a unified framework to help humanitarian organisations in their relief efforts. We conduct extensive experiments using textual and imagery content from millions of tweets posted during the three major disaster events in the 2017 Atlantic Hurricane season.

  abstract  = {Social sensing is based on the idea that communities or groups of people can provide a set of information similar to those obtainable from a sensor network. Emergency management is a candidate field of application for social sensing. In this work we describe the design, implementation and deployment of a decision support system for the detection and the damage assessment of earthquakes in Italy. Our system exploits the messages shared in real-time on Twitter, one of the most popular social networks in the world. Data mining and natural language processing techniques are employed to select meaningful and comprehensive sets of tweets. We then apply a burst detection algorithm in order to promptly identify outbreaking seismic events. Detected events are automatically broadcasted by our system via a dedicated Twitter account and by email notifications. In addition, we mine the content of the messages associated to an event to discover knowledge on its consequences. Finally we compare our results with official data provided by the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV), the authority responsible for monitoring seismic events in Italy. The INGV network detects shaking levels produced by the earthquake, but can only model the damage scenario by using empirical relationships. This scenario can be greatly improved with direct information site by site. Results show that the system has a great ability to detect events of a magnitude in the region of 3.5, with relatively low occurrences of false positives. Earthquake detection mostly occurs within seconds of the event and far earlier than the notifications shared by INGV or by other official channels. Thus, we are able to alert interested parties promptly. Information discovered by our system can be extremely useful to all the government agencies interested in mitigating the impact of earthquakes, as well as the news agencies looking for fresh information to publish. \textcopyright{} 2014 ACM.},

This paper reports the experience we gained from developing and using a web-enabled system for the online detection and monitoring of unpredictable events such as earthquakes and floods. The system captures selected message streams from Twitter and offers decision support functionalities for acquiring situational awareness from textual content and for quantifying the impact of disasters. The software architecture of the system is described and the approaches adopted for messages filtering, emergency detection and emergency monitoring are discussed. For each module, the results of real-world experiments are reported. The modular design makes the system easy configurable and allowed us to conduct experiments on different crises, including Emilia earthquake in 2012 and Genoa flood in 2014.

Social networks play therefore a fundamental role in the development of decision support systems that could help both government and citizens. From user-generated contents, the information about an occurring emergency could be acquired and exploited to understand the critical event and its evolution over time. On the other side, the social interactions among users can be exploited as a dissemination gate to make people informed. In this paper, we present a decision support system for earthquake management based on machine learning and natural language processing to effectively extract and organize knowledge from online social media data. The proposed system, on a real Twitter dataset, has shown significant results for identifying messages related to (real) earthquakes and critical tremors, highlighting those posts provided by spontaneous users and containing any actionable knowledge about damages, magnitude, location and time references. \textcopyright{} 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

ATHENA recognizes that citizens are currently under-utilized in crises and that they are often willing to engage in the response effort. Social media provides a robust platform for this interaction. Due to the volume and fast paced nature of the incoming data streams, the challenges for ATHENA system are how to integrate and process this data and then how to transform it into intelligence to be used by law enforcement agencies and the public alike.

We show that a common approach for understanding emotional response in text: Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) can be substantially improved using machine learning. Starting with tweets flagged by LIWC as containing content related to the issue of death, we devise a categorization scheme for death-related tweets to induce automatic text classification of such content. This improved methodology reveals striking differences in the magnitude and duration of increases in death-related talk between these communities. It also detects subtle shifts in the nature of death-related talk. Our results offer lessons for gauging public response and for developing interventions in the wake of a tragedy.

  abstract  = {Social media are an emerging new paradigm in interdisciplinary research in crisis informatics. They bring many opportunities as well as challenges to all fields of application and research involved in the project of using social media content for an improved disaster management. Using the Central European flooding 2013 as our case study, we optimize and apply methods from the field of natural language processing and unsupervised machine learning to investigate the thematic and temporal structure of German social media communication. By means of topic model analysis, we will investigate which kind of content was shared on social media during the event. On this basis, we will, furthermore, investigate the development of topics over time and apply temporal clustering techniques to automatically identify different characteristic phases of communication. From the results, we, first, want to reveal properties of social media content and show what potential social media have for improving disaster management in Germany. Second, we will be concerned with the methodological issue of finding and adapting natural language processing methods that are suitable for analysing social media data in order to obtain information relevant for disaster management. With respect to the first, application-oriented focal point, our study reveals high potential of social media content in the factual, organizational and psychological dimension of the disaster and during all stages of the disaster management life cycle. Interestingly, there appear to be systematic differences in thematic profile between the different platforms Facebook and Twitter and between different stages of the event. In context of our methodological investigation, we claim that if topic model analysis is combined with appropriate optimization techniques, it shows high applicability for thematic and temporal social media analysis in disaster management.

  abstract  = {Big data created by social media and mobile networks provide an exceptional opportunity to mine valuable insights from them. This information is harnessed by business entities to measure the level of customer satisfaction but its application in disaster response is still in its inflection point. Social networks are increasingly used for emergency communications and help related requests. During disaster situations, such emergency requests need to be mined from the pool of big data for providing timely help. Though government organizations and emergency responders work together through their respective national disaster response framework, the sentiment of the affected people during and after the disaster determines the success of the disaster response and recovery process. In this paper, we propose a big data driven approach for disaster response through sentiment analysis. The proposed model collects disaster data from social networks and categorize them according to the needs of the affected people. The categorized disaster data are classified through machine learning algorithm for analyzing the sentiment of the people. Various features like, parts of speech and lexicon are analyzed to identify the best classification strategy for disaster data. The results show that lexicon based approach is suitable for analyzing the needs of the people during disaster. The practical implication of the proposed methodology is the real-time categorization and classification of social media big data for disaster response and recovery. This analysis helps the emergency responders and rescue personnel to develop better strategies for effective information management of the rapidly changing disaster environment. \textcopyright{} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Currently, that potentially valuable information remains mostly unused by the command staff, mainly because the sheer amount of information cannot be handled efficiently. In this paper, we show an approach for turning massive amounts of unstructured citizen-generated content into relevant information supporting the command staff in making better informed decisions.

The recent advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT) and the evolution in big data analytics (BDA) technologies have provided an open opportunity to develop highly needed disaster resilient smart city environments. In this paper, we propose and discuss the novel reference architecture and philosophy of a disaster resilient smart city (DRSC) through the integration of the IoT and BDA technologies. The proposed architecture offers a generic solution for disaster management activities in smart city incentives. A combination of the Hadoop Ecosystem and Spark are reviewed to develop an efficient DRSC environment that supports both real-time and offline analysis. The implementation model of the environment consists of data harvesting, data aggregation, data pre-processing, and big data analytics and service platform. A variety of datasets (i.e., smart buildings, city pollution, traffic simulator, and twitter) are utilized for the validation and evaluation of the system to detect and generate alerts for a fire in a building, pollution level in the city, emergency evacuation path, and the collection of information about natural disasters (i.e., earthquakes and tsunamis). The evaluation of the system efficiency is measured in terms of processing time and throughput that demonstrates the performance superiority of the proposed architecture. Moreover, the key challenges faced are identified and briefly discussed. \textcopyright{} 2013 IEEE.},

However, the considerable diversity, increasing volume, and high dynamics of social streams of large events continue to be significant challenges that must be overcome to ensure effective exploration. We propose a novel framework by which to handle complex social streams on a budget PC. This framework features two components: 1) an online method to detect important time periods (i.e., subevents), and 2) a tailored GPU-assisted Self-Organizing Map (SOM) method, which clusters the tweets of subevents stably and efficiently. Based on the framework, we present StreamExplorer to facilitate the visual analysis, tracking, and comparison of a social stream at three levels. At a macroscopic level, StreamExplorer uses a new glyph-based timeline visualization, which presents a quick multi-faceted overview of the ebb and flow of a social stream. At a mesoscopic level, a map visualization is employed to visually summarize the social stream from either a topical or geographical aspect. At a microscopic level, users can employ interactive lenses to visually examine and explore the social stream from different perspectives. Two case studies and a task-based evaluation are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of StreamExplorer. \textcopyright{} 1995-2012 IEEE.},

Challenges remain in the discovery of appropriate sensor information and in the real-time fusion of this information. This is important, in particular, in disaster management, where the flow of information is overwhelming and sensor data must be easily accessible for non-experts (fire brigade officers). We propose to support, in this context, sensor discovery and fusion by "semantically" annotating sensor services with terms from an ontology. In doing so, we employ several well-known techniques from the GIS and Semantic Web worlds, e.g., for semantic matchmaking and data presentation. The novel contribution of our work is a carefully arranged tool architecture, aimed at providing optimal integration support, while keeping the cost for creating the annotations at bay. We address technical details regarding the interaction and functionality of the components, and the design of the required ontology. Based on the architecture, after minimal off-line effort, on-line discovery and integration of sensor data is no more difficult than using standard GIS applications. \textcopyright{} Springer-Verlag 2009.},

In this paper, we introduce the SoKNOS support system, which is a functional prototype for such software using semantic technologies for various purposes. Ontologies are used for creating a mutual understanding between developers and end users from different organizations. Information sources and services are annotated with ontologies for improving the provision of the right information at the right time, for connecting existing systems and databases to the SoKNOS system, and for providing an ontology-based visualization. Furthermore, the users' actions are constantly supervised, and errors are avoided by employing ontology-based consistency checking. We show how the pervasive and holistic use of semantic technologies leads to a significant improvement of both the development and the usability of disaster management software, and present some key lessons learned from employing semantic technologies in a large-scale software project. \textcopyright{} 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Not only this MIS shoul support the interoperability of the partners' information systems but it is also dedicated to coordinate their activities through a collaborative process. One of the first and main steps towards such a MIS, is to elaborate a common and sharable reference model built to characterize crisis situations. Such a model is also an input for automated reasoning to elaborate and adapt a crisis solving collaborative process. This article presents the objective of the project, our approach and our first results: a UML metamodel of crisis situation and its corresponding OWL ontology on top of which deductions are possible.},

Hurricane Katrina demonstrated the usefulness of Web sites in dealing with natural disasters. However, little is known about the necessary contents and structures of Web-based information systems for natural disaster management. In this paper, we focus on developing an ontology structure of elements for Web-based disaster management systems. Web elements are identified, following a grounded-theory approach, from an inventory of 6032 Web pages drawn from 100 disaster management Web sites. Selected semistructured data representation approaches are used to organize the resulting ontology structure, which consists of 2094 Web elements. The ontology structure is further coded into a Web-based system, allowing easy online access. \textcopyright{} 2006 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {During times of crisis microblogging platforms such as Twitter have played an important role as a communication channel to distribute information. Particularly, disaster-related tweets are valuable resources when tagged with their location for detecting unexpected events. However, they often contain different types of location and one of the main challenges is resolving the ambiguity involved in their locations. The process of identifying phrase portions in unstructured texts with possible spatial aspects and disambiguating these references by linking them to geographic coordinates is known as Geotagging. In the context of crisis management, this paper presents OzCT geotagger that automatically detects the location(s) mentioned in the content of tweets with three possibilities: definite, ambiguous and no-location. It also semantically annotates the tweet components utilizing existing and new ontologies. The OzCT geotagger has been recently deployed in a trial system of the OzCrisisTracker application. Experiments demonstrate that the precision and recall for detection of the definite locations against geotagging by human judgement are on average of 80\%. We also conclude that the accuracy of geographical focus of the OzCT geotagger is considerably higher than other systems. While existing geocoding systems have lower coverage for suburb and street focus, our approach detects suburbs in more than 60\% situations. \textcopyright{} 2014 The British Computer Society.

  abstract  = {These days, with the development of information technology, new paradigms have been created through academical and technological convergence in various areas. The IT convergence draws much attention as the next generation technology for disaster prevention and management in the construction and transportation area. Along with global warming, global climate changes and unusual weather occur around the world, and consequently disasters become more huge. IT convergence based disaster management service makes it possible to quickly respond to unexpected disasters in the ubiquitous environment and mitigate the disasters. Although research on disaster prevention and management has constantly been conducted, it is relatively slow to develop the technology for disaster prediction and prevention. For efficient safety and disaster prevention and management in the next generation IT convergence, it is essential to establish a systematic disaster prevention technology and a disaster prevention information system. In this paper, we proposed ontology-driven slope modeling for disaster management service through the convergence of construction, transportation technology and IT. User profile, environment information, location information, weather index, slope stability, disaster, statistics and analysis of disasters, and forest fire disaster index are used to build internal context information, external context information, and service context information. Ontology-based context awareness modeling of the landslides and disasters generated is constructed, and relevant rules are generated by inference engine. Based on the ontology of external and internal context awareness, the rules of service inference derived by inference engine are produced using prot\'eg\'e 5.0. According to the service inference rules, disaster control services best fitting for users' environment is provided. By addressing the social issues related to disaster prevention and response and judging the potential risk of disasters, the proposed method can contribute to improving the safety of the public and the quality of their life. Social consensus on the necessity of prevention of urban climate disasters can be formed easily, and a ripple effect is expected on the situational response to natural disaster. \textcopyright{} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

OMS first maps the sentences of input documents onto an ontology, then links the given query to a specific node in the ontology, and finally extracts the summary from the sentences in the subtree rooted at the query node. By using the domain-related ontology, OMS can better capture the semantic relevance between the query and the sentences, and thus lead to better summarization results. As a byproduct, the final summary generated by OMS can be represented as a tree showing the hierarchical relationships of the extracted sentences. Evaluation results on the collection of press releases by Miami-Dade County Department of Emergency Management during Hurricane Wilma in 2005 demonstrate the efficacy of OMS. \textcopyright{} 2010 ACM.},

SI involves interfacing and enabling the interactions of component elements to collectively provide the functionality needed by the system to accomplish its goals. SI is part of the overall system development life cycle. SI increases in complexity when there are legacy systems that need to be integrated, and when humans are an integral part of the system. An added layer of complexity is introduced when the system has to exhibit resilience and adaptability in the face of contingencies in the operational environment. This paper addresses key perspectives and challenges in SI. Specifically, it presents the integration continuum, ranging from loose to tight integration. It presents a SI ontology that captures the key issues and concerns in a standard language. It also presents various categories of integration and their unique challenges. This paper is intended to clarify various types of integration and to stimulate new ways of thinking about SI. \textcopyright{} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

We analyze thirty such models to uncover that many DM activities are actually common even when the events vary. We then create a unified view of DM in the form of a metamodel. We apply a metamodelling process to ensure that this metamodel is complete and consistent. We validate it and present a representational layer to unify and share knowledge as well as combine and match different DM activities according to different disaster situations. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The potential benefits of using a semantic-type EWS include easier sensor and data source plug-and-play, simpler, richer, and more dynamic metadata-driven data analysis and easier service interoperability and orchestration. The challenges faced during practical deployments of semantic EWSs are the need for scalable time-sensitive data exchange and processing (especially involving heterogeneous data sources) and the need for resilience to changing ICT resource constraints in crisis zones. We present a novel IoT EWS system framework that addresses these challenges, based upon a multisemantic representation model. We use lightweight semantics for metadata to enhance rich sensor data acquisition. We use heavyweight semantics for top level W3C Web Ontology Language ontology models describing multileveled knowledge-bases and semantically driven decision support and workflow orchestration. This approach is validated through determining both system related metrics and a case study involving an advanced prototype system of the semantic EWS, integrated with a deployed EWS infrastructure. \textcopyright{} 2013 IEEE.},

Earthquake emergency plans and emergency command systems are among the most important research and operations components of emergency response. These components commonly come with challenges, such as the pertinence of emergency commands and the operability of the countermeasures to be improved. The promise for solving this problem resides with applying knowledge that aids intelligence creation for decision-making. In this paper, we put forward a conceptual model of knowledge for earthquake disaster emergency response (EDER); compositions of EDER knowledge are introduced within architecture. A modeling method incorporating geo-ontology is used to build basic modeling primitives. Geo-ontology serves to represent geospatial characteristics of the EDER knowledge and addresses a need for semantic interoperability in the modeling process. A decision problem framework and a case study have been used as theoretical framework and an application test, respectively, to evaluate the EDER knowledge architecture and models. The EDER knowledge model provides a foundation for intelligent emergency response that helps solve knowledge problems to improve earthquake disaster response. \textcopyright{} 2014 Taylor \& Francis.},

  abstract  = {Mobile alerts, notifications and location-based emergency warning systems are now an established part of mobile government strategies in an increasing number of countries worldwide. In Australia the national emergency warning system (NEWS) was instituted after the tragic Black Saturday Victorian Bushfires of February 2009. NEWS has enabled the provision of public information from the government to the citizen during emergencies anywhere and any time. Moving on from traditional short message service (SMS) notifications and cell broadcasting to more advanced location-based services, this paper explores the major issues faced by government, business and society at large, toward the realization of a fully fledged emergency system for personal mobile devices. This qualitative study contains two phases: phase 1 gathered issues from the general public via an open-ended survey question, and phase 2 gathered issues from key informant interviews. The data was analyzed using qualitative content analysis techniques. The results are presented in a narrative form granting detailed insight into the main challenges faced in the deployment of a mobile government application. The complex interplay between government agencies, telecommunications carriers and the Australian public is presented, ultimately leading down a path of regulation. By using a qualitative approach it is hoped that the intimate lessons learnt in the Australian landscape can be applied to other nations considering mobile government applications. The outcome of the paper is predominantly practical providing a series of recommendations toward the successful deployment of mobile government applications. \textcopyright{} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Design/methodology/approach: Observations and semi-structured interviews were carried out during 2007-2008. The data material comprises a total of 248 hours of observations on 20 occasions and 57 interviews with 80 people. Findings: The study identifies the difference between rhetoric and practice in connection with accident work. Collaboration is seen as a rhetorical ideal rather than something that is carried out in normal practice. Asymmetry, uncertainty and lack of incentives are important explanations as to why only limited forms of collaboration are actually implemented. Research limitations/implications: The paper shows a distinction between collaboration as rhetoric and practical collaboration at accident scenes. Practical implications: The article proposes a multi-faceted collaboration concept. In this way, collaboration can be developed and refined. Originality/value: The results of the study show that police, fire, and ambulance services want to develop excellent forms of collaboration at the accident scene, but avoid this as it leads to uncertainty and asymmetries and because of a lack of incentives. However, simpler forms of collaboration may be realistic in the organisation of everyday work at accident scenes. \textcopyright{} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

However, the challenging, and often stressful, nature of such events, together with the cognitive demands imposed on operational witnesses as a function of their active role, may impair subsequent recall. We compared the recall performance of operational active witnesses with that of nonoperational observer witnesses for a challenging simulated scenario involving an armed perpetrator. Seventy-six police officers participated in pairs. In each pair, 1 officer (active witness) was armed and instructed to respond to the scenario as they would in an operational setting, while the other (observer witness) was instructed to simply observe the scenario. All officers then completed free reports and responded to closed questions. Active witnesses showed a pattern of heart rate activity consistent with an increased stress response during the event, and subsequently reported significantly fewer correct details about the critical phase of the scenario. The level of stress experienced during the scenario mediated the effect of officer role on memory performance. Across the sample, almost one-fifth of officers reported that the perpetrator had pointed a weapon at them although the weapon had remained in the waistband of the perpetrator's trousers throughout the critical phase of the encounter. These findings highlight the need for investigator awareness of both the impact of operational involvement and stress-related effects on memory for ostensibly salient details, and reflect the importance of careful and ethical information elicitation techniques.},

A search of the archival literature yielded very few journal articles and technical reports on community preparedness for tsunami hazard in the United States. Consequently, we conducted interviews with 12 key informants within six coastal communities in four counties of Washington and Oregon. These two sources of information revealed a number of important deficiencies related to emergency response preparedness and risk communication. Based on this assessment, we propose a series of specific recommendations for research on agency notification and mobilization, protective action selection and timing, warning and evacuation, and risk communication and perception. Addressing research needs in these areas would improve coastal communities' ability to respond effectively to tsunami threat. \textcopyright{} 2010 ASCE.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study aims at providing qualitative and quantitative evidence on the relevance of two broadly used mental health self-report measures--Impact of Event Scale Revised (IES-R) and Hopkins Symptom Checklist 37 for Adolescents (HSCL-37A)--for use in Eastern Democratic of Congo, as no psychological assessment instruments were available for this region. We therefore describe an apt procedure to adapt and translate standard screening instruments in close collaboration with the local community, feasible under challenging conditions in emergency settings. METHOD: Focus groups and interviews with community key figures in psychosocial care were employed to ensure local validity of the adaptation and translation process. Consequently, the questionnaires' internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) and construct validity (principal component analysis, testing of theoretical assumptions) were assessed based on a clustered school-based community survey among 1,046 adolescents (13-21 years) involving 13 secondary schools in the Ituri district in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. RESULTS: Key-informant qualitative data confirmed face and construct validity of all IES-R and all HSCL-37A anxiety items. Additional culture-specific symptoms of adolescent mental ill-health were added to enhance local relevance of the HSCL-37A depression and externalizing subscales. Quantitative analysis of the survey data revealed adequate internal consistency and construct validity of both adapted measures, yet weaker results for the externalizing scale. Furthermore, it confirmed the internalizing/externalizing factor structure of the HSCL-37A and the theoretically deviating intrusion/arousal versus active avoidance factor structure for the IES-R. CONCLUSIONS: Community-based adaptation can extend the validity and local relevance of mental health screening in emergency and low-income settings. The availability of adequate Swahili and Congolese French adaptations of the IES-R and HSCL-37A could stimulate the assessment of psychosocial needs in war-exposed Eastern Congolese adolescents.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the potential for developing surface water flood warnings in England and Wales by focusing upon the requirements of professional and public flood warning responders. The recent development of Extreme Rainfall Alerts (ERAs) presents an opportunity to develop such warnings. However, uncertainties concerning event probability, the location and likely impact of floods would significantly complicate the risk communication and warning response process limiting warning effectiveness. Feedback, interviews and workshops involving professional emergency responders and public focus groups allow the reception to existing ERAs and to proposed linked flood warnings to be gauged. For professional responders ERAs are useful and the majority take preparatory actions on receipt of them. There is support for surface water flood warnings among professional responders, particularly if uncertainties can be reduced and warnings tailored to their requirements. Higher quality linkages are required between rainfall intensity and duration and flooding and between forecasters, warners and the warned. Most flood experienced members of the public want surface water flood warnings but scepticism exists about ability to effectively provide them. Reasons include inherent forecasting uncertainties and lack of confidence in the responsible authorities. Existing constraints on developing warnings include reliability issues surrounding flood warnings, the current level of understanding of probabilities and low levels of public flood risk awareness. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract  = {Purpose - This paper seeks to contribute to a more effective co-ordination of humanitarian operations by military and civilian organizations involved in a peace support mission in response to a complex emergency. Design/methodology/ approach - The information processing view, in particular Galbraith's typology of generic mechanisms for achieving co-ordination, is taken as the theoretical framework. This framework is subsequently applied to the co-ordination of humanitarian operations by military and civilian organizations. Empirical data are derived from a set of expert interviews with both military and civilian respondents in The Netherlands and a four week visit to Kabul and Baghlan, a province in northern Afghanistan. During this visit 40 military respondents have been interviewed and over 60 meetings have been held with local authorities, humanitarian organizations, small entrepreneurs, refugees and local villagers. Finally, conclusions are drawn and recommendations are provided with regard to a more effective co-ordination of humanitarian operations in a peace support mission. Findings - The article's main finding is that "self-contained tasks" in combination with lateral relations are the dominant co-ordination mechanisms. "Slack resources", though observed in practice, is not considered a viable co-ordination mechanism since this implies an excess, and thus waste, of scarce resources. "Information systems" are, unfortunately, not well-developed leading to mismatches between policy and practice. Keeping "self-contained tasks" as the major co-ordination mechanism, the main recommendation is to develop and implement innovative "information systems", that can also be used to support "lateral relations", in particular those between military and civil actors. Originality/value - The paper applies the information processing perspective to a unique and important subject, namely co-ordination between military and humanitarian organizations in peace support missions. \textcopyright{} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

  abstract  = {Infrastructure planning involves a multitude of concerns, where safety considerations generally range behind economic issues. We hypothesize that safety issues are insufficiently considered in infrastructure planning due to the lack of a shared view among the different safety experts, and that a carefully designed participatory group decision making method can support safety experts in reaching a shared view on the problem. To test our hypothesis, we developed a participatory methodology that helps infrastructure providers, spatial planners and emergency responders converge their views on safety in infrastructure planning. The methodology integrates dynamically and interactively risk and deterministic safety analysis and deliberation processes; the methodology has been integrated in a mobile multimedia group decision network system. We discuss the application of this method for the Northeastern Connection of the Betuweline: a freight railway linking Rotterdam Harbor to the German Ruhrgebiet. Structured questionnaires, audio tapes, observations and interviews with the participants confirm the method's merit in reaching a shared view and consensus for safety aspects in infrastructure planning. The results of this study provide evidence for our hypothesis and indicate ways for how to consider more efficiently and effectively safety issues in infrastructure planning. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

With a projected increase in extreme precipitation as well as an ongoing urbanization, pluvial flood damage is expected to increase in the future. Therefore, further insights, especially on the adverse consequences of pluvial floods and their mitigation, are needed. To gain more knowledge, empirical damage data from three different pluvial flood events in Germany were collected through computer-aided telephone interviews. Pluvial flood awareness as well as flood experience were found to be low before the respective flood events. The level of private precaution increased considerably after all events, but is mainly focused on measures that are easy to implement. Lower inundation depths, smaller potential losses as compared with fluvial floods, as well as the fact that pluvial flooding may occur everywhere, are expected to cause a shift in damage mitigation from precaution to emergency response. However, an effective implementation of emergency measures was constrained by a low dissemination of early warnings in the study areas. Further improvements of early warning systems including dissemination as well as a rise in pluvial flood preparedness are important to reduce future pluvial flood damage.},

Design and Methods: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 50Vancouver-based IDU participating in the Scientific Evaluation of Supervised Injecting cohort. Audio-recorded interviews elicited IDU perspectives regarding the impact of SIF use on access to health and social services. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and a thematic analysis was conducted. Results: Fifty IDU, including 21 women, participated in this study. IDU narratives indicate that the SIF serves to facilitate access to health care by providing much-needed care on-site and connects IDU to external services through referrals.Participants' perspectives suggest that the SIF has facilitated increased uptake of health and social services among IDU. Discussion and Conclusions: Although challenges related to access to care remain in many settings, SIF have potential to promote health by facilitating enhanced access to health-care and social services through a model of care that is accessible to high-risk IDU. \textcopyright{} 2009 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs.},

We found that microblogged data is useful to responders in situations where information is limited, such as at the beginning of an emergency response effort, and when the risks of ignoring an accurate response outweigh the risks of acting on an incorrect one. In some situations, such as search and rescue operations, microblogged data may never meet the standards of quality required. In others, such as resource and supply management, microblogging data could be useful as long as it is appropriately verified and classified.},

  abstract = {Situation analyses were conducted by 11 multidisciplinary teams in the West African Prevention of Maternal Mortality (PMM) Network, with technical assistance from Columbia University's Center for Population and Family Health. Data on the functioning and use of facilities were used to identify resource needs and management problems at facilities providing emergency obstetric care in Ghana, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. The researchers looked at the number and distribution of facilities, trends in utilization patterns, time from admission to treatment at facilities, functioning of referral systems, availability of essential supplies, staffing patterns, and staff perceptions of services. Research methods included patient flow studies, inventories of drugs and supplies, and retrospective reviews of hospital records. Qualitative information was also collected through interviews with staff. This paper summarizes the principal findings of the situation analyses. Normal deliveries fell markedly where users' fees were initiated. However, the number of women with complications seen increased at several of these sites. The lack of drugs and supplies at the facilities had an adverse effect on utilization of non-emergency services and on women's survival chances. Users' fees and unavailability of supplies contributed to unacceptably long waiting times between admission and treatment at most sites. These long waiting times were also found to be associated with higher case fatality rates. Staff-to-patient ratios at the sites improved or remained stable, and do not appear to be associated with changes in quality of care. Strategies to address the problems identified include: the establishment of small revolving fund schemes to ensure the availability of supplies; the creation of 24-hr pharmacy services; the establishment of on-call rooms for staff; and the improvement of staff attitudes and morale through various types of training activities. These situation analyses were useful for assessing health system factors contributing to maternal deaths. The information on complicated cases and on hospital functioning provided a marked improvement over previous studies limited to data on deliveries and maternal deaths. Low-cost techniques such as the patient-flow studies and drug and supply inventories provided valuable information which was easily intelligible to program planners. These types of studies are recommended for use prior to the development of projects designed to reduce maternal deaths. \textcopyright{} 1995.},

The research methods are grounded in action research, participatory design, and situation-awareness oriented design. The completion of a more than two-year industrial secondment and six-month field studies ensured that a full understanding of user requirements had been obtained. A service-centered architecture was proposed to satisfy these user requirements. The proposed architecture consists mainly of information gathering, database management, and decision support services. The decision support services include situational overview, instant risk assessment, emergency response preplan, and disaster development prediction. Abstracting from the experience obtained while building this system, we outline a set of design principles in the general domain of information systems (IS) development for emergency management. These design principles form a contribution to the information systems literature because they provide guidance to developers who are aiming to support emergency response and the development of such systems that have not yet been adequately met by any existing types of IS. We are proud that the information platform developed was deployed in the real world and used in the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. \textcopyright{} 2012 INFORMS.},

Previous research extracts resource needs directly from the text (e.g. "Power cut to Coney Island and Brighton beach" indicates a power need). This approach assumes that citizens derive and write about specific needs from their observations, properly specified for the emergency response system, an assumption that is not consistent with general conversational behavior. In our study, Twitter messages (tweets) from Hurricane Sandy in 2012 clearly indicate power blackouts, but not their probable implications (e.g. loss of power to hospital life support systems). We use a domain model to capture such interdependencies between resources and needs. We represent these dependencies in an ontology that specifies the functional association between resources. Accurate interpretation of resource need/supply also depends on the location of a message. We show how inference based on a domain model combined with location detection and interpretation in the social data can enhance situational awareness, e.g., predicting a medical emergency before it is reported as critical.

  abstract  = {Previous works in social media processing during crisis management highlight a paradox: Citizens are extensively sharing data from the field of the crisis, while decision-makers are looking for information about the emerging risks they need to address. Several tools already exist to help taking advantage of this new important source of data. However, few made their way to decision-makers, mainly because they remain resource-consuming. That is why the question of a tool, able to process social media in near-real time, to deliver actionable information from the field is still pending. Based on a state of the art of the Natural Language Processing tools and systems dedicated to the use of social media data to improve the situational awareness of the decision-makers, this paper aims to describe a way to provide them with a first comprehensive system which asset is to completely address the challenge, from the collection of the data to their interpretation and understanding and finally offer situational models. In this sense, the paper focuses on the thorough detail of the business and consequent technical challenges that are raised, and a work in progress proposal to address them in a comprehensive manner. \textcopyright{} IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2019.},

It requires capturing and integrating information from sources such as satellite images, local sensors and social media content generated by local people. A bold obstacle to capturing, representing and integrating such heterogeneous and diverse information is lack of a proper ontology which properly conceptualizes this domain, aggregates and unifies datasets. Thus, in this paper, we introduce empathi ontology which conceptualizes the core concepts describing the domain of emergency managing and planning of hazard crises. Although empathi has a coarse-grained view, it considers the necessary concepts and relations being essential in this domain.

  abstract  = {Purpose: This paper aims to argue that traditional ethical theories used in disaster response may be inadequate and particularly strained by the emergence of new technologies and social media, particularly with regard to privacy. The paper suggests incorporation of care ethics into the disaster ethics nexus to better include the perspectives of disaster affected communities. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents a theoretical examination of privacy and care ethics in the context of social media/digitally enhanced disaster response. Findings: The paper proposes an ethics of care can fruitfully by used by public and private agents in disaster management. Its relational ontology restores the priority of fostering good relationships between stakeholders, thus giving central importance to values such as transparency and trust and the situated knowledge of disaster-affected communities. Research limitations/implications: This paper presents theoretical research and is limited by the availability of empirical data. There is opportunity for future research to evaluate the impact of a conscious adoption of an ethics of care by disaster management agents. Practical implications: An ethos of care ethics needs to be mainstreamed into disaster management organisations and digital initiatives. Social implications: This paper argues that power asymmetry in disaster response renders the public vulnerable to abuse, and that the adoption of care ethics can support disaster management agents in recognising this power imbalance and wielding power responsibly. Originality/value: This paper examines the applicability of an alternative ethical framework to novel circumstances. \textcopyright{} 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

  abstract  = {Nowadays, social media is one of the essential sharing of information and proliferation tools because it spreads text messages, news, pictures, or videos in real-time. During the disaster, Japanese people use social media to exchange real-time information for their social interaction. Twitter is the most popular tool that has been used for disaster response in Japan. Even though many disaster systems have been created and used for disaster mitigation in Japan, most of them are assumed to be used by the Japanese in the Japanese language. From this problem, this study focuses on the way to create a disaster response system and community service to help, collect, and extract information on social media to help disaster mitigation becomes more important. This paper aims to investigate the tweets by focusing on noun keywords during the Osaka North Earthquake on 18 June 2018 with a data set of more than 9,000,000 tweets. The process presented classify social media messages by using ontology, word similarity, frequency of keyword, and evaluate results of natural language processing. We organize the messages into 15 categories and used as the classification algorithms with machine learning features of the count of each category word in the sentences. The result tweets were statistically compared with the keyword in each category to classify the content and collecting disaster information and using the result to build the analysis system. \textcopyright{} 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

  abstract  = {Natural disasters are events that humans cannot control, and Japan has suffered from many such disasters over its long history. Many of these have caused severe damage to human lives and property. These days, numerous Japanese people have gained considerable experience preparing for disasters and are now striving to predict the effects of disasters using social network services (SNSs) to exchange information in real time. Currently, Twitter is the most popular and powerful SNS tool used for disaster response in Japan because it allows users to exchange and disseminate information quickly. However, since almost all of the Japanese-related content is also written in the Japanese language, which restricts most of its benefits to Japanese people, we feel that it is necessary to create a disaster response system that would help people who do not understand Japanese. Accordingly, this paper presents the framework of a question-answering (QA) system that was developed using a Twitter dataset containing more than nine million tweets compiled during the Osaka North Earthquake that occurred on 18 June 2018. We also studied the structure of the questions posed and developed methods for classifying them into particular categories in order to find answers from the dataset using an ontology, word similarity, keyword frequency, and natural language processing. The experimental results presented herein confirm the accuracy of the answer results generated from our proposed system. \textcopyright{} 2020 by the authors.},

  abstract  = {Across the world, various crisis situations occur causing chaos and confusion as to how to deal with them. Hence, finding ways to transmit the necessary information regarding how to handle such incidents to various parties involved in such events is fundamental. As such, the field of crisis management focuses on determining the actions to undertake to quickly respond to the occurrence of a disaster. Ultimately, crisis management systems strive to guide individuals to better prepare themselves for any future encounter of crisis situations. In this paper, we investigate emergency circumstances, mainly natural disasters, to detail the requirements for workflow notations managing them. Taking into account these requirements, we propose a domain-specific software language (DSL) for crisis management based on the Use Case Map (UCM) metamodel. While workflow notations do exist that can model the basic procedures to undergo when a crisis incident occurs, none focuses specifically on crisis management systems or considers the 3D environment in which emergency situations unfold. The proposed DSL provides built-in support for modeling location-based, social media-inspired interactions in the 3D environment of a disaster, allowing crisis experts to author emergency procedures which are subsequently followed by crisis respondents and victims. The long-term goal is to reduce the damages or losses, in terms of property and life, caused by a crisis, benefiting us all as well as the environment we live in. \textcopyright{} 2018 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {Crowdsourced Data (CSD) has recently received increased attention in many application areas including disaster management. Convenience of production and use, data currency and abundancy are some of the key reasons for attracting this high interest. Conversely, quality issues like incompleteness, credibility and relevancy prevent the direct use of such data in important applications like disaster management. Moreover, location information availability of CSD is problematic as it remains very low in many crowd sourced platforms such as Twitter. Also, this recorded location is mostly related to the mobile device or user location and often does not represent the event location. In CSD, event location is discussed descriptively in the comments in addition to the recorded location (which is generated by means of mobile device's GPS or mobile communication network). This study attempts to semantically extract the CSD location information with the help of an ontological Gazetteer and other available resources. 2011 Queensland flood tweets and Ushahidi Crowd Map data were semantically analysed to extract the location information with the support of Queensland Gazetteer which is converted to an ontological gazetteer and a global gazetteer. Some preliminary results show that the use of ontologies and semantics can improve the accuracy of place name identification of CSD and the process of location information extraction.},

Managers and instructors must handle potentially incomplete and conflicting field-observation data and make decisions in real-time in order to control the flow of the exercise and to keep it in line with the training objectives. In simulation-based exercises, managers and instructors have access to a rich set of real-time data, with an increased potential to closely monitor the trainees' actions, and to keep the exercise on track. To assist exercise managers and instructors, data about the on-going exercise can be filtered, aggregated and refined by real-time decision-support systems. We have developed a model and a prototype decision-support system, using stream-based reasoning to assist exercise managers and instructors in real-time. The approach takes advantage of topic maps for ontological representation and a complex-event processing engine for analyzing the data stream from a virtual-reality simulator for crisis-management training. Aggregated data is presented both on-screen, in Twitter, and in the form of topic maps. \textcopyright{} 2012 ISCRAM.},

Indeed, social media may ease the sharing of information between citizens and Public Safety Organizations, but it also enables the rapid spreading of inaccurate information. As information is now provided and shared by anyone to anyone, information credibility is a major issue. We propose an approach to detect rumor in social media. This paper describes our work on semantic graph based information fusion, enhanced with uncertainty management capabilities. The uncertainty management capability enables managing the different level of credibility of actors of an emergency (different PSO officers and citizens). Functions for information synthesis, conflicting information detection and information evaluation were developed and test during experimentation campaigns. The synthesis and conflicting information detection functionalities are very welcome by end-users. However, the uncertainty management is a combinatorial approach which remains a limitation for use with large amount of information.},

Sometimes information about disasters even finds its way faster to social media websites than it reaches regular news companies and emergency services. Yet emergency services still have not found a way to put this potential to an effective use. Within our project "EmerGent", we are developing a system for emergency services to process and analyse information from social media. The aim is to transform the high volume of noisy data into a low volume of rich content that is useful to emergency personnel. To achieve this goal, it is important to understand both, the nature of social media, and emergency services as the target domain. Hence, we decided to design an ontology that covers the fields of social media and emergency management (SMEM). In this paper, we explain the steps we took during the development process of the ontology and the structure of the ontology itself. \textcopyright{} 2016.},

  abstract  = {Aim/Purpose Vis-\`a-vis management of crisis and disaster situations, this paper focuses on important use cases of social media functions, such as information collection \& dissemination, disaster event identification \& monitoring, collaborative problem-solving mechanism, and decision-making process. With the prolific utilization of disaster-based ontological framework, a strong disambiguation system is realized, which further enhances the searching capabilities of the user request and provides a solution of unambiguous in nature. Background Even though social media is information-rich, it has created a challenge for deriving a decision in critical crisis-related cases. In order to make the whole process effective and avail quality decision making, sufficiently clear semantics of such information is necessary, which can be supplemented through employing semantic web technologies. Methodology This paper evolves a disaster ontology-based system availing a framework model for monitoring uses of social media during risk and crisis-related events. The proposed system monitors a discussion thread discovering whether it has reached its peak or decline after its root in the social forum like Twitter. The content in social media can be accessed through two typical ways: Search Application Program Interfaces (APIs) and Streaming APIs. These two kinds of API processes can be used interchangeably. News content may be filtered by time, geographical region, keyword occurrence and availability ratio. With the support of disaster ontology, domain knowledge extraction and comparison against all possible concepts are availed. Besides, the proposed method makes use of SPARQL to disambiguate the query and yield the results which produce high precision. Contribution The model provides for the collection of crisis-related temporal data and decision making through semantic mapping of entities over concepts in a disaster ontology we developed, thereby disambiguating potential named entities. Results of empirical testing and analysis indicate that the proposed model outperforms similar other models. Findings Crucial findings of this research lie in three aspects: (1) Twitter streams and conventional news media tend to offer almost similar types of news coverage for a specified event, but the rate of distribution among topics/categories differs. (2) On specific events such as disaster, crisis or any emergency situations, the volume of information that has been accumulated between the two news media stands divergent and filtering the most potential information poses a challenging task. (3) Relational mapping/co-occurrence of terms has been well designed for conventional news media, but due to shortness and sparseness of tweets, there remains a bottleneck for researchers. Recommendations Though metadata avails collaborative details of news content and it has been for Practitioners conventionally used in many areas like information retrieval, natural language processing, and pattern recognition, there is still a lack of fulfillment in semantic aspects of data. Hence, the pervasive use of ontology is highly suggested that build semantic-oriented metadata for concept-based modeling, information flow searching and knowledge exchange. Recommendation The strong recommendation for researchers is that instead of heavily relying for Researchers on conventional Information Retrieval (IR) systems, one can focus more on ontology for improving the accuracy rate and thereby reducing ambiguous terms persisting in the result sets. In order to harness the potential information to derive the hidden facts, this research recommends clustering the information from diverse sources rather than pruning a single news source. It is advisable to use a domain ontology to segregate the entities which pose ambiguity over other candidate sets thus strengthening the outcome. Impact on Society The objective of this research is to provide informative summarization of happenings such as crisis, disaster, emergency and havoc-based situations in the real world. A system is proposed which provides the summarized views of such happenings and corroborates the news by interrelating with one another. Its major task is to monitor the events which are very booming and deemed important from a crowd's perspective. Future Research In the future, one shall strive to help to summarize and to visualize the potential information which is ranked high by the model. \textcopyright{} 2019 Informing Science Institute.

With automated data collection from 100,000 mainstream media sources and Twitter, natural-language processing for automated filtering, and manual curation to ensure accuracy, the Vaccine Sentimeter offers a global real-time view of vaccination conversations online. To assess the system's utility, we followed two events: polio vaccination in Pakistan after a news story about a Central Intelligence Agency vaccination ruse and subsequent attacks on health care workers, and a controversial episode in a television program about adverse events following human papillomavirus vaccination. For both events, increased online activity was detected and characterized. For the first event, Twitter response to the attacks on health care workers decreased drastically after the first attack, in contrast to mainstream media coverage. For the second event, the mainstream and social media response was largely positive about the HPV vaccine, but antivaccine conversations persisted longer than the provaccine reaction. Using the Vaccine Sentimeter could enable public health professionals to detect increased online activity or sudden shifts in sentiment that could affect vaccination uptake. \textcopyright{} 2016 by Project HOPE- The People-to-People Health Foundation.},

However, social scientists have not explained why some advocacy organizations produce social media messages that inspire far-ranging conversation among social media users, whereas the vast majority of them receive little or no attention. I argue that advocacy organizations are more likely to inspire comments from new social media audiences if they create "cultural bridges," or produce messages that combine conversational themes within an advocacy field that are seldom discussed together. I use natural language processing, network analysis, and a social media application to analyze how cultural bridges shaped public discourse about autism spectrum disorders on Facebook over the course of 1.5 years, controlling for various characteristics of advocacy organizations, their social media audiences, and the broader social context in which they interact. I show that organizations that create substantial cultural bridges provoke 2.52 times more comments about their messages from new social media users than those that do not, controlling for these factors. This study thus offers a theory of cultural messaging and public deliberation and computational techniques for text analysis and application-based survey research. \textcopyright{} 2016, National Academy of Sciences.

Traditional search methods are no longer able to address the more complex information seeking behaviour in media streams, which has evolved towards sense making, learning, investigation, and social search. Unlike carefully authored news text and longer web context, social media streams pose a number of new challenges, due to their large-scale, short, noisy, context-dependent, and dynamic nature. This paper defines five key research questions in this new application area, examined through a survey of state-of-the-art approaches for mining semantics from social media streams; user, network, and behaviour modelling; and intelligent, semantic-based information access. The survey includes key methods not just from the Semantic Web research field, but also from the related areas of natural language processing and user modelling. In conclusion, key outstanding challenges are discussed and new directions for research are proposed. \textcopyright{} 2014-IOS Press and the authors.},

We used the product domain of smartphone as our case study. The experiments on 100,000 collected posts related to smartphones showed that the system could help indicating the customers' sentiments towards the product features, such as Application, Screen, and Camera.

  abstract  = {Background: The misuse of prescription opioids (MUPO) is a leading public health concern. Social media are playing an expanded role in public health research, but there are few methods for estimating established epidemiological metrics from social media. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that the geographic variation of social media posts mentioning prescription opioid misuse strongly correlates with government estimates of MUPO in the last month. Methods: We wrote software to acquire publicly available tweets from Twitter from 2012 to 2014 that contained at least one keyword related to prescription opioid use (n~=~3,611,528). A medical toxicologist and emergency physician curated the list of keywords. We used the semantic distance (SemD) to automatically quantify the similarity of meaning between tweets and identify tweets that mentioned MUPO. We defined the SemD between two words as the shortest distance between the two corresponding word-centroids. Each word-centroid represented all recognized meanings of a word. We validated this automatic identification with manual curation. We used Twitter metadata to estimate the location of each tweet. We compared our estimated geographic distribution with the 2013\textendash 2015 National Surveys on Drug Usage and Health (NSDUH). Results: Tweets that mentioned MUPO formed a distinct cluster far away from semantically unrelated tweets. The state-by-state correlation between Twitter and NSDUH was highly significant across all NSDUH survey years. The correlation was strongest between Twitter and NSDUH data from those aged 18\textendash 25 (r~=~0.94, p~{$<~$}0.01 for 2012; r~=~0.94, p~{$<~$}0.01 for 2013; r~=~0.71, p~=~0.02 for 2014). The correlation was driven by discussions of opioid use, even after controlling for geographic variation in Twitter usage. Conclusions: Mentions of MUPO on Twitter correlate strongly with state-by-state NSDUH estimates of MUPO. We have also demonstrated that a natural language processing can be used to analyze social media to provide insights for syndromic toxicosurveillance. \textcopyright{} 2017, American College of Medical Toxicology.},

  abstract  = {Sentiment analysis requires a lot of information coming from different sources and about different topics to be retrieved and fused. For this reason, one of the most important subtasks of sentiment analysis is subjectivity detection, i.e., the removal of `factual' or `neutral' comments that lack sentiment. It is possibly the most essential subtask of sentiment analysis as sentiment classifiers are often optimized to categorize text as either negative or positive and, hence, forcefully fit unopinionated sentences into one of these two categories. This article reviews hand-crafted and automatic models for subjectivity detection in the literature. It highlights the key assumptions these models make, the results they obtain, and the issues that still need to be explored to further our understanding of subjective sentences. Lastly, the advantages and limitations of each approach are compared. The methods can be broadly categorized as hand-crafted, automatic, and multi-modal. Hand-crafted templates work well on strong sentiments, however they are unable to identify weakly subjective sentences. Automatic methods such as deep learning provide a meta-level feature representation that generalizes well on new domains and languages. Multi-modal methods can combine the abundant audio and video forms of social data with text using multiple kernels. We conclude that the high-dimensionality of n-gram features and temporal nature of sentiments in long product reviews are the major challenges in sentiment mining from text. \textcopyright{} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract  = {Big data analytics has gained wide attention from both academia and industry as the demand for understanding trends in massive datasets increases. Recent developments in sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and the ubiquity of the Internet of Things (IoT) have increased the collection of data (including health care, social media, smart cities, agriculture, finance, education, and more) to an enormous scale. However, the data collected from sensors, social media, financial records, etc. is inherently uncertain due to noise, incompleteness, and inconsistency. The analysis of such massive amounts of data requires advanced analytical techniques for efficiently reviewing and/or predicting future courses of action with high precision and advanced decision-making strategies. As the amount, variety, and speed of data increases, so too does the uncertainty inherent within, leading to a lack of confidence in the resulting analytics process and decisions made thereof. In comparison to traditional data techniques and platforms, artificial intelligence techniques (including machine learning, natural language processing, and computational intelligence) provide more accurate, faster, and scalable results in big data analytics. Previous research and surveys conducted on big data analytics tend to focus on one or two techniques or specific application domains. However, little work has been done in the field of uncertainty when applied to big data analytics as well as in the artificial intelligence techniques applied to the datasets. This article reviews previous work in big data analytics and presents a discussion of open challenges and future directions for recognizing and mitigating uncertainty in this domain. \textcopyright{} 2019, The Author(s).},

  abstract  = {Background Patients routinely use Twitter to share feedback about their experience receiving healthcare. Identifying and analysing the content of posts sent to hospitals may provide a novel real-time measure of quality, supplementing traditional, survey-based approaches. Objective To assess the use of Twitter as a supplemental data stream for measuring patientperceived quality of care in US hospitals and compare patient sentiments about hospitals with established quality measures. Design 404 065 tweets directed to 2349 US hospitals over a 1-year period were classified as having to do with patient experience using a machine learning approach. Sentiment was calculated for these tweets using natural language processing. 11 602 tweets were manually categorised into patient experience topics. Finally, hospitals with {$\geq$}50 patient experience tweets were surveyed to understand how they use Twitter to interact with patients. Key results Roughly half of the hospitals in the US have a presence on Twitter. Of the tweets directed toward these hospitals, 34 725 (9.4\%) were related to patient experience and covered diverse topics. Analyses limited to hospitals with {$\geq$}50 patient experience tweets revealed that they were more active on Twitter, more likely to be below the national median of Medicare patients (p{$<$}0.001) and above the national median for nurse/patient ratio (p=0.006), and to be a nonprofit hospital (p{$<$}0.001). After adjusting for hospital characteristics, we found that Twitter sentiment was not associated with Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) ratings (but having a Twitter account was), although there was a weak association with 30-day hospital readmission rates (p=0.003). Conclusions Tweets describing patient experiences in hospitals cover a wide range of patient care aspects and can be identified using automated approaches. These tweets represent a potentially untapped indicator of quality and may be valuable to patients, researchers, policy makers and hospital administrators.},

  abstract  = {Public opinion becomes increasingly salient in the ex post evaluation stage of large infrastructure projects which have significant impacts to the environment and the society. However, traditional survey methods are inefficient in collection and assessment of the public opinion due to its large quantity and diversity. Recently, Social media platforms provide a rich data source for monitoring and assessing the public opinion on controversial infrastructure projects. This paper proposes an assessment framework to transform unstructured online public opinions on large infrastructure projects into sentimental and topical indicators for enhancing practices of ex post evaluation and public participation. The framework uses web crawlers to collect online comments related to a large infrastructure project and employs two natural language processing technologies, including sentiment analysis and topic modeling, with spatio-temporal analysis, to transform these comments into indicators for assessing online public opinion on the project. Based on the framework, we investigate the online public opinion of the Three Gorges Project on China's largest microblogging site, namely, Weibo. Assessment results present spatial-temporal distributions of post intensity and sentiment polarity, reveals major topics with different sentiments and summarizes managerial implications, for ex post evaluation of the world's largest hydropower project. The proposed assessment framework is expected to be widely applied as a methodological strategy to assess public opinion in the ex post evaluation stage of large infrastructure projects. \textcopyright{} 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract  = {Background: Uptake of medicinal drugs (preventive or treatment) is among the approaches used to control disease outbreaks, and therefore, it is of vital importance to be aware of the counts or frequencies of most commonly used drugs and trending topics about these drugs from consumers for successful implementation of control measures. Traditional survey methods would have accomplished this study, but they are too costly in terms of resources needed, and they are subject to social desirability bias for topics discovery. Hence, there is a need to use alternative efficient means such as Twitter data and machine learning (ML) techniques. Objective: Using Twitter data, the aim of the study was to (1) provide a methodological extension for efficiently extracting widely consumed drugs during seasonal influenza and (2) extract topics from the tweets of these drugs and to infer how the insights provided by these topics can enhance seasonal influenza surveillance. Methods: From tweets collected during the 2012-13 flu season, we first identified tweets with mentions of drugs and then constructed an ML classifier using dependency words as features. The classifier was used to extract tweets that evidenced consumption of drugs, out of which we identified the mostly consumed drugs. Finally, we extracted trending topics from each of these widely used drugs' tweets using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). Results: Our proposed classifier obtained an F1 score of 0.82, which significantly outperformed the two benchmark classifiers (ie, P\&lt;.001 with the lexicon-based and P=.048 with the 1-gram term frequency [TF]). The classifier extracted 40,428 tweets that evidenced consumption of drugs out of 50,828 tweets with mentions of drugs. The most widely consumed drugs were influenza virus vaccines that had around 76.95\% (31,111/40,428) share of the total; other notable drugs were Theraflu, DayQuil, NyQuil, vitamins, acetaminophen, and oseltamivir. The topics of each of these drugs exhibited common themes or experiences from people who have consumed these drugs. Among these were the enabling and deterrent factors to influenza drugs uptake, which are keys to mitigating the severity of seasonal influenza outbreaks. Conclusions: The study results showed the feasibility of using tweets of widely consumed drugs to enhance seasonal influenza surveillance in lieu of the traditional or conventional surveillance approaches. Public health officials and other stakeholders can benefit from the findings of this study, especially in enhancing strategies for mitigating the severity of seasonal influenza outbreaks. The proposed methods can be extended to the outbreaks of other diseases. \textcopyright Ireneus Kagashe, Zhijun Yan, Imran Suheryani.},

  abstract  = {Depression is a disease that can dramatically lower quality of life. Symptoms of depression can range from temporary sadness to suicide. Embarrassment, shyness, and the stigma of depression are some of the factors preventing people from getting help for their problems. Contemporary social media technologies like Internet forums or micro-blogs give people the opportunity to talk about their feelings in a confidential anonymous environment. However, many participants in such networks may not recognize the severity of their depression and their need for professional help. Our approach is to develop a method that detects symptoms of depression in free text, such as posts in Internet forums, chat rooms and the like. This could help people appreciate the significance of their depression and realize they need to seek help. In this work Natural Language Processing methods are used to break the textual information into its grammatical units. Further analysis involves detection of depression symptoms and their frequency with the help of words known as indicators of depression and their synonyms. Finally, similar to common paper-based depression scales, e.g., the CES-D, that information is incorporated into a single depression score.In this evaluation study, our depressive mood detection system, DepreSD (. Depression Symptom Detection), had an average precision of 0.84 (range 0.72-1.0 depending on the specific measure) and an average F measure of 0.79 (range 0.72-0.9). \textcopyright{} 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

We used Natural Language Processing to extract names of species and places from text messages in a citizen science project. Bootstrap and Maximum Entropy methods were used to assess the uncertainty in the model predictions based on crowd-sourced data from the EnjoyMoths project in Taiwan. We compared uncertainty in the predictions obtained from the project and from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) field data for seven focal species of moth. The proximity to locations of easy access and the Ripley K method were used to test the level of spatial bias and randomness of the crowd-sourced data against GBIF data. Our results show that extracting information to identify the names of species and their locations from crowd-sourced data performed well. The results of the spatial bias and randomness tests revealed that the crowd-sourced data and GBIF data did not differ significantly in respect to both spatial bias and clustering. The prediction models developed using the crowd-sourced dataset were the most effective, followed by those that were developed using the combined dataset. Those that performed least well were based on the small sample size GBIF dataset. Our method demonstrates the potential for using data collected by citizen scientists and the extraction of information from vast social networks. Our analysis also shows the value of citizen science data to improve biodiversity information in combination with data collected by professionals. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract  = {Sentiment analysis and opinion mining is the field of study that analyzes people's opinions, sentiments, evaluations, attitudes, and emotions from written language. It is one of the most active research areas in natural language processing and is also widely studied in data mining, Web mining, and text mining. In fact, this research has spread outside of computer science to the management sciences and social sciences due to its importance to business and society as a whole. The growing importance of sentiment analysis coincides with the growth of social media such as reviews, forum discussions, blogs, micro-blogs, Twitter, and social networks. For the first time in human history, we now have a huge volume of opinionated data recorded in digital form for analysis. Sentiment analysis systems are being applied in almost every business and social domain because opinions are central to almost all human activities and are key influencers of our behaviors. Our beliefs and perceptions of reality, and the choices we make, are largely conditioned on how others see and evaluate the world. For this reason, when we need to make a decision we often seek out the opinions of others. This is true not only for individuals but also for organizations. This book is a comprehensive introductory and survey text. It covers all important topics and the latest developments in the field with over 400 references. It is suitable for students, researchers and practitioners who are interested in social media analysis in general and sentiment analysis in particular. Lecturers can readily use it in class for courses on natural language processing, social media analysis, text mining, and data mining. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2012 by Morgan \& Claypool.},

  abstract  = {Sentiment analysis or opinion mining is the computational study of people's opinions, appraisals, attitudes, and emotions toward entities, individuals, issues, events, topics and their attributes. The task is technically challenging and practically very useful. For example, businesses always want to find public or consumer opinions about their products and services. Potential customers also want to know the opinions of existing users before they use a service or purchase a product. With the explosive growth of social media (i.e., reviews, forum discussions, blogs and social networks) on the Web, individuals and organizations are increasingly using public opinions in these media for their decision making. However, finding and monitoring opinion sites on the Web and distilling the information contained in them remains a formidable task because of the proliferation of diverse sites. Each site typically contains a huge volume of opinionated text that is not always easily deciphered in long forum postings and blogs. The average human reader will have difficulty identifying relevant sites and accurately summarizing the information and opinions contained in them. Moreover, it is also known that human analysis of text information is subject to considerable biases, e.g., people often pay greater attention to opinions that are consistent with their own preferences. People also have difficulty, owing to their mental and physical limitations, producing consistent results when the amount of information to be processed is large. Automated opinion mining and summarization systems are thus needed, as subjective biases and mental limitations can be overcome with an objective sentiment analysis system. In the past decade, a considerable amount of research has been done in academia [58,76]. There are also numerous commercial companies that provide opinion mining services. In this chapter, we first define the opinion mining problem. From the definition, we will see the key technical issues that need to be addressed. We then describe various key mining tasks that have been studied in the research literature and their representative techniques. After that, we discuss the issue of detecting opinion spam or fake reviews. Finally, we also introduce the research topic of assessing the utility or quality of online reviews. \textcopyright{} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {Background: Few studies have examined inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients' knowledge and understanding of biologic therapies outside traditional surveys. Here, we used social media data to examine IBD patients' understanding of the risks and benefits associated with biologic therapies and how this affects decision-making. Methods: We collected posts from Twitter and e-forum discussions from {$>$}3000 social media sites posted between June 27, 2012 and June 27, 2015. Guided by natural language processing, we identified posts with specific IBD keywords that discussed the risks and/or benefits of biologics. We then manually coded the resulting posts and performed qualitative analysis using ATLAS.ti software. A hierarchical coding structure was developed based on the keyword list and relevant themes were identified through manual coding. Results: We examined 1598 IBD-related posts, of which 452 (28.3\%) centered on the risks and/or benefits of biologics. There were 5 main themes: negative experiences and concerns with biologics (n = 247; 54.6\%), decision-making surrounding biologic use (n = 169; 37.4\%), positive experiences with biologics (n = 168; 37.2\%), information seeking from peers (n = 125; 27.7\%), and cost (n = 38; 8.4\%). Posts describing negative experiences primarily commented on side effects from biologics, concerns about potential side effects and increased cancer risk, and pregnancy safety concerns. Posts on decision-making focused on nonbiologic treatment options, hesitation to initiate biologics, and concerns about changing or discontinuing regimens. Conclusions: Social media reveals a wide range of themes governing patients' experience and choice with IBD biologics. The complexity of navigating their risk-benefit profiles suggests merit in creating online tailored decision tools to support IBD patients' decision-making with biologic therapies.

The aims of this study are to demonstrate the use of Twitter as a real-time method of Ebola outbreak surveillance to monitor information spread, capture early epidemic detection, and examine content of public knowledge and attitudes. Methods We collected tweets mentioning Ebola in English during the early stage of the current Ebola outbreak from July 24-August 1, 2014. Our analysis for this observational study includes time series analysis with geologic visualization to observe information dissemination and content analysis using natural language processing to examine public knowledge and attitudes. Results A total of 42,236 tweets (16,499 unique and 25,737 retweets) mentioning Ebola were posted and disseminated to 9,362,267,048 people, 63 times higher than the initial number. Tweets started to rise in Nigeria 3-7 days prior to the official announcement of the first probable Ebola case. The topics discussed in tweets include risk factors, prevention education, disease trends, and compassion. Conclusion Because of the analysis of a unique Twitter dataset captured in the early stage of the current Ebola outbreak, our results provide insight into the intersection of social media and public health outbreak surveillance. Findings demonstrate the usefulness of Twitter mining to inform public health education. \textcopyright{} 2015 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.},

With the proliferation of videos posted online (e.g., on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter) for product reviews, movie reviews, political views, and more, affective computing research has increasingly evolved from conventional unimodal analysis to more complex forms of multimodal analysis. This is the primary motivation behind our first of its kind, comprehensive literature review of the diverse field of affective computing. Furthermore, existing literature surveys lack a detailed discussion of state of the art in multimodal affect analysis frameworks, which this review aims to address. Multimodality is defined by the presence of more than one modality or channel, e.g., visual, audio, text, gestures, and eye gage. In this paper, we focus mainly on the use of audio, visual and text information for multimodal affect analysis, since around 90\% of the relevant literature appears to cover these three modalities. Following an overview of different techniques for unimodal affect analysis, we outline existing methods for fusing information from different modalities. As part of this review, we carry out an extensive study of different categories of state-of-the-art fusion techniques, followed by a critical analysis of potential performance improvements with multimodal analysis compared to unimodal analysis. A comprehensive overview of these two complementary fields aims to form the building blocks for readers, to better understand this challenging and exciting research field. \textcopyright{} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract  = {Emotion recognition has emerged as an important research area which may reveal some valuable input to a variety of purposes. People express their emotions directly or indirectly through their speech, facial expressions, gestures or writings. Many different sources of information, such as speech, text and visual can be used to analyze emotions. Nowadays, writings take many forms of social media posts, micro-blogs, news articles, etc., and the content of these posts can be useful resource for text mining to discover and unhide various aspects, including emotions. Extracting emotions behind these postings is an immense and complicated task. To tackle this problem, researchers from diverse fields are trying to find an efficient way to more precisely detect human emotions from various sources, including text and speech. In this sense, different word-based and sentence-based techniques, machine learning, natural language processing methods, etc., have been used to achieve better accuracy. Analyzing emotions can be helpful in many different domains. One such domain is human computer interaction. With the help of emotion recognition, computers can make better decisions to help users. With the increase in popularity of robotic research, emotion recognition will also help making human\textendash robot interaction more natural. This survey covers existing emotion detection research efforts, emotion models, emotion datasets, emotion detection techniques, their features, limitations and some possible future directions. We focus on reviewing research efforts analyzing emotions based on text and speech. We investigated different feature sets that have been used in existing methodologies. We summarize basic achievements in the field and highlight possible extensions for better outcome. \textcopyright{} 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract  = {Text mining has become one of the trendy fields that has been incorporated in several research fields such as computational linguistics, Information Retrieval (IR) and data mining. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques were used to extract knowledge from the textual text that is written by human beings. Text mining reads an unstructured form of data to provide meaningful information patterns in a shortest time period. Social networking sites are a great source of communication as most of the people in today's world use these sites in their daily lives to keep connected to each other. It becomes a common practice to not write a sentence with correct grammar and spelling. This practice may lead to different kinds of ambiguities like lexical, syntactic, and semantic and due to this type of unclear data, it is hard to find out the actual data order. Accordingly, we are conducting an investigation with the aim of looking for different text mining methods to get various textual orders on social media websites. This survey aims to describe how studies in social media have used text analytics and text mining techniques for the purpose of identifying the key themes in the data. This survey focused on analyzing the text mining studies related to Facebook and Twitter; the two dominant social media in the world. Results of this survey can serve as the baselines for future text mining research. \textcopyright{} 2017 ASTES Publishers. All rights reserved.},

Our main contribution consists of combining multiple influenza-like illnesses (ILI) activity estimates, generated independently with each data source, into a single prediction of ILI utilizing machine learning ensemble approaches. Our methodology exploits the information in each data source and produces accurate weekly ILI predictions for up to four weeks ahead of the release of CDC's ILI reports. We evaluate the predictive ability of our ensemble approach during the 2013\textendash 2014 (retrospective) and 2014\textendash 2015 (live) flu seasons for each of the four weekly time horizons. Our ensemble approach demonstrates several advantages: (1) our ensemble method's predictions outperform every prediction using each data source independently, (2) our methodology can produce predictions one week ahead of GFT's real-time estimates with comparable accuracy, and (3) our two and three week forecast estimates have comparable accuracy to real-time predictions using an autoregressive model. Moreover, our results show that considerable insight is gained from incorporating disparate data streams, in the form of social media and crowd sourced data, into influenza predictions in all time horizons. \textcopyright{} 2015 Santillana et al.},

  abstract  = {In the last decades, the availability of digital user-generated documents from social media has dramatically increased. This massive growth of user-generated content has also affected traditional shopping behaviour. Customers have embraced new communication channels such as microblogs and social networks that enable them not only just to talk with friends and acquaintances about their shopping experience, but also to search for opinions expressed by complete strangers as part of their decision making processes. Uncovering how customers feel about specific products or brands and detecting purchase habits and preferences has traditionally been a costly and highly time-consuming task which involved the use of methods such as focus groups and surveys. However, the new scenario calls for a deep assessment of current market research techniques in order to better interpret and profit from this ever-growing stream of attitudinal data. With this purpose, we present a novel analysis and classification of user-generated content in terms of it belonging to one of the four stages of the Consumer Decision Journey Court etal. (2009) (i.e. the purchase process from the moment when a customer is aware of the existence of the product to the moment when he or she buys, experiences and talks about it). Using a corpus of short texts written in English and Spanish and extracted from different social media, we identify a set of linguistic patterns for each purchase stage that will be then used in a rule-based classifier. Additionally, we use machine learning algorithms to automatically identify business indicators such as the Marketing Mix elements McCarthy and Brogowicz (1981). The classification of the purchase stages achieves an average precision of 74\%. The proposed classification of texts depending on the Marketing Mix elements expressed achieved an average precision of 75\% for all the elements analysed. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract  = {Background: Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of social media data sources for a wide range of public health goals, including disease surveillance, mental health trends, and health perceptions and sentiment. Most such research has focused on English-language social media for the task of disease surveillance. Objective: We investigated the value of Chinese social media for monitoring air quality trends and related public perceptions and response. The goal was to determine if this data is suitable for learning actionable information about pollution levels and public response. Methods: We mined a collection of 93 million messages from Sina Weibo, China's largest microblogging service. We experimented with different filters to identify messages relevant to air quality, based on matching and topic modeling. We evaluated the reliability of the data filters by comparing message volume per city to air particle pollution rates obtained from the Chinese government for 74 cities. Additionally, we performed a qualitative study of the content of pollution-related messages by coding a sample of 170 messages for relevance to air quality, and whether the message included details such as a reactive behavior or a health concern. Results: The volume of pollution-related messages is highly correlated with particle pollution levels, with Pearson correlation values up to .718 (n=74, P{$<$}.001). Our qualitative results found that 67.1\% (114/170) of messages were relevant to air quality and of those, 78.9\% (90/114) were a firsthand report. Of firsthand reports, 28\% (32/90) indicated a reactive behavior and 19\% (17/90) expressed a health concern. Additionally, 3 messages of 170 requested that action be taken to improve quality. Conclusions: We have found quantitatively that message volume in Sina Weibo is indicative of true particle pollution levels, and we have found qualitatively that messages contain rich details including perceptions, behaviors, and self-reported health effects. Social media data can augment existing air pollution surveillance data, especially perception and health-related data that traditionally requires expensive surveys or interviews. \textcopyright Shiliang Wang, Michael J Paul, Mark Dredze.},

Business organizations need to process and study these sentiments to investigate data and to gain business insights. Hence, to analyze these sentiments, various machine learning, and natural language processing-based approaches have been used in the past. However, deep learning-based methods are becoming very popular due to their high performance in recent times. This paper provides a detailed survey of popular deep learning models that are increasingly applied in sentiment analysis. We present a taxonomy of sentiment analysis and discuss the implications of popular deep learning architectures. The key contributions of various researchers are highlighted with the prime focus on deep learning approaches. The crucial sentiment analysis tasks are presented, and multiple languages are identified on which sentiment analysis is done. The survey also summarizes the popular datasets, key features of the datasets, deep learning model applied on them, accuracy obtained from them, and the comparison of various deep learning models. The primary purpose of this survey is to highlight the power of deep learning architectures for solving sentiment analysis problems. \textcopyright{} 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

Unlike traditional observational cohort studies conducted through questionnaires and self-reported surveys, we explore the reliable detection of clinical depression from tweets obtained unobtrusively. Based on the analysis of tweets crawled from users with self-reported depressive symptoms in their Twitter profiles, we demonstrate the potential for detecting clinical depression symptoms which emulate the PHQ-9 questionnaire clinicians use today. Our study uses a semi-supervised statistical model to evaluate how the duration of these symptoms and their expression on Twitter (in terms of word usage patterns and topical preferences) align with the medical findings reported via the PHQ-9.

  abstract        = {Effective crisis management has long relied on both the formal and informal response communities. Social media platforms such as Twitter increase the participation of the informal response community in crisis response. Yet, challenges remain in realizing the formal and informal response communities as a cooperative work system. We demonstrate a supportive technology that recognizes the existing capabilities of the informal response community to identify needs (seeker behavior) and provide resources (supplier behavior), using their own terminology. To facilitate awareness and the articulation of work in the formal response community, we present a technology that can bridge the differences in terminology and understanding of the task between the formal and informal response communities. This technology includes our previous work using domain-independent features of conversation to identify indications of coordination within the informal response community. In addition, it includes a domain-dependent analysis of message content (drawing from the ontology of the formal response community and patterns of language usage concerning the transfer of property) to annotate social media messages. The resulting repository of annotated messages is accessible through our social media analysis tool, Twitris. It allows recipients in the formal response community to sort on resource needs and availability along various dimensions including geography and time. Thus, computation indexes the original social media content and enables complex querying to identify contents, players, and locations. Evaluation of the computed annotations for seeker-supplier behavior with human judgment shows fair to moderate agreement. In addition to the potential benefits to the formal emergency response community regarding awareness of the observations and activities of the informal response community, the analysis serves as a point of reference for evaluating more computationally intensive efforts and characterizing the patterns of language behavior during a crisis. \textcopyright{} Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.},

We find that coordinating social media use in communities requires alignments with local incident management systems and, in particular, existing sociotechnical infrastructure for managing citizen-reported information. These alignments open limited roles for community volunteers, notably coordinating the redistribution of official information; and stand to reshape the workflows and infrastructures of incident management systems by pushing emergency dispatchers to proactively process indirect reports of incidents obtained on social media, and integrate tools that can access hyperlocal data, curate incident and situational reports, and facilitate sensemaking among officials confronted with multiple information sources. \textcopyright{} Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management ISCRAM.

Social media allow emergency services to reach the public easily in the context of crisis communication and receive valuable information (e.g. pictures) from social media data.

To mitigate these issues, this paper proposes the semi-automatic creation of alerts including keyword, relevance and information quality filters based on cross-platform social media data. We conducted empirical studies and workshops with emergency services across Europe to raise requirements, then iteratively designed and implemented an approach to support emergency services, and performed multiple evaluations, including live demonstrations and field trials, to research the potentials of social media-based alerts.

Public Safety Organisations like the police, rescue and emergency services, as well as emergency response centres require a reliable and up-to-date situation picture at all times. In the event of demanding multiauthority operations, like crises, multi-casualty incidents, and emergencies, the role of Public Safety Organisations' 24/7 situation centres becomes vital. Typically, the different authorities have their own situation centres, which cooperate by using different technological solutions like a multi-authority radio network and real-time video connections. The use of new technology, information systems, UAVs, and body cameras facilitates receiving and processing information to build a more accurate situation picture. However, all the technology may cause moments of information overload. Furthermore, the increasing role of citizens in producing valuable information for Public Safety Organisations via social media, for instance, should not be overlooked. The role of information management is crucial in forming situational awareness and a common operational picture, especially in time-critical and rapidly evolving multi-authority missions. The literature related to Public Safety Organisations' situation centres is scarce, especially when explored from the information flow and situation picture point of view. In this paper, we explore the current technologies, practices, and action models in use to ensure adequate information-sharing between Public Safety Organisations to enable a common operational picture and collaborative decision-making in hybrid environments. The empirical data were collected through interviews with staff at different Public Safety Organisations and analysed using qualitative content analysis. The results suggest that the critical factors in ensuring information flow and thus the situation picture are communication tools, access to all the necessary channels and groups, common operational picture systems to enable shared situational awareness, and jointly approved cooperation plans combined with regular training and drills. In addition, human factors play an important role in complex, multi-authority missions.

It can also be concluded that in the near future the authorities need to develop tools and processes for utilising big data produced by citizens in social media.},

To date, public social media has been explored as a potential alert system during natural disasters, but high levels of noise (i.e. non-relevant content) present challenges in both understanding social experiences of a disaster and in facilitating disaster recovery. This study builds on current research by uniquely using social media data, collected in the field through qualitative interviews, to create a supervised machine learning model. Collected data represents rescuers and rescuees during the 2017 Hurricane Harvey. Preliminary findings indicate a 99\% accuracy in classifying data between signal and noise for signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8. We also find 99\% accuracy in classification between respondent types (volunteer rescuer, official rescuer, and rescuee). We furthermore compare human and machine coded attributes, finding that Google Vision API is a more reliable source of detecting attributes for the training set. \textcopyright{} 2018 IEEE.},

This study used semi-structured interviews and photo elicitation techniques to better understand how wide-scale rescues occurred during the 2017 Hurricane Harvey flooding in the Greater Houston, Texas USA area. We found that citizens used diverse apps and social media-related platforms during these rescues and that they played one of three roles: rescuer, dispatcher, or information compiler. The key social media coordination challenges these rescuers faced were incomplete feedback loops, unclear prioritization, and communication overload.

Our work started with the development of a real-time event detection system which is able to detect emerging events from tweets. Subsequently, we incorporate the system with an event-ontology construction module to mining temporal, spatial, topical and potential relational entities to dynamically create the ontology upon the collected social data sets. The framework implemented in this work could be applied to various domains such as crisis management and knowledge sharing of business intelligence. The experimental result shows that our system framework is capable of detecting events from social streams and, accurately extracting ontology entities associated with specific events for decision supporting applications.

This metamodel includes several points of view, specific to the domain of crisis management (including characteristics of the crisis, of the context, of the actors involved, etc.). Besides, the models built from this metamodel can be used as information bases for tools dedicated to support collaboration of actors: collaborative processes may be deduced from the models (and then orchestrated). Similarly, the evolution of the situation can be recorded as updates of the crisis models and contribute to the agility of the crisis management.},

The coding scheme was refined and adapted into a set of instructions for qualitative coders on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The contribution of this work is a coding scheme that is more directly related to the information needs of public safety professionals. Implications of early results using the refined coding scheme are discussed in terms of proposed automated methods to identify actionable information for dispatch of first responders during emergency incidents.},

In the clustering phase, we use filters to merge tweets that are similar to one another; and finally, in the extraction phase, we extract tokens and phrases that report specific information about different classes of infrastructure damage, damage types, and casualties.

The challenges and complexity of the world require Soldiers to provide a broad range of capabilities. It is increasingly difficult to anticipate the multiple emerging threats to United States security interests and adjust the Army's organization, materiel resources, and facilities to cope with them. Because the Army cannot quickly optimize these components to meet the wide range of threats, commanders optimize their most agile resource: their people. Success in combat demands a technological and human edge over future threats. Developing and maintaining a human edge requires a sustained investment in the physical, cognitive, and social aspects of Soldiers and civilians. This investment includes continuous innovation in training, education, leader development, and both talent acquisition and talent management. Advanced situational awareness (known as ASA) skill development optimizes human performance through building the skills necessary to develop agile, resilient, adaptive, and innovative Soldiers who thrive in conditions of uncertainty and chaos.},

Interestingly, preferences formalized using maut have almost the same expressiveness as the ones formalized in pddl3 while being much easier to model. Next, we present a new heuristic for planning with preferences which is based on the Choquet integral. Finally, we introduce ChoPlan a proof-of-concept planner solving maut-encoded planning problems using the aforementioned heuristic.

Social media used around crises involves self-organizing behavior that can produce accurate results, often in advance of official communications. This allows affected population to send tweets or text messages, and hence, make them heard. The ability to classify tweets and text messages automatically, together with the ability to deliver the relevant information to the appropriate personnel are essential for enabling the personnel to timely and efficiently work to address the most urgent needs, and to understand the emergency situation better. In this study, we developed a reusable information technology infrastructure, called Enhanced Messaging for the Emergency Response Sector (EMERSE). The components of EMERSE are: (i) an iPhone application; (ii) a Twitter crawler component; (iii) machine translation; and (iv) automatic message classification. While each component is important in itself and deserves a detailed analysis, in this paper we focused on the automatic classification component, which classifies and aggregates tweets and text messages about the Haiti disaster relief so that they can be easily accessed by non-governmental organizations, relief workers, people in Haiti, and their friends and families.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a theoretical model of situation awareness based on its role in dynamic human decision making in a variety of domains. Situation awareness is presented as a predominant concern in system operation, based on a descriptive view of decision making. The relationship between situation awareness and numerous individual and environmental factors is explored. Among these factors, attention and working memory are presented as critical factors limiting operators from acquiring and interpreting information from the environment to form situation awareness, and mental models and goal-directed behavior are hypothesized as important mechanisms for overcoming these limits. The impact of design features, workload, stress, system complexity, and automation on operator situation awareness is addressed, and a taxonomy of errors in situation awareness is introduced, based on the model presented. The model is used to generate design implications for enhancing operator situation awareness and future directions for situation awareness research.},

This work codifies the information needs of emergency dispatchers and first responders as a method to identify actionable information on social media. Through a design workshop with public safety professionals at a Public-Safety Answering Point (PSAP), The Charleston County Consolidated 911 Center in the United States. We develop a set of information requirements that must be satisfied to dispatch first responders and meet their immediate situational awareness needs. We then present a manual coding scheme to identify information satisfying these requirements in social media posts and apply this scheme to fictitious tweets professionals propose as actionable information to better assess ways to communicate this information. Finally, we propose automated methods from previous literature in the field that can be used to implement these methods in the future.},

The focus of the paper is on studying subjective measures of interestingness. These measures are classified into actionable and unexpected, and the relationship between them is examined. The unexpected measure of interestingness is defined in terms of the belief system that the user has. Interestingness of a pattern is expressed in terms of how it affects the belief system.

  abstract   = {In times of mass emergency, vast amounts of data are generated via computer-mediated communication (CMC) that are difficult to manually cull and organize into a coherent picture. Yet valuable information is broadcast, and can provide useful insight into time- and safety-critical situations if captured and analyzed properly and rapidly. We describe an approach for automatically identifying messages communicated via Twitter that contribute to situational awareness, and explain why it is beneficial for those seeking information during mass emergencies.  We collected Twitter messages from four different crisis events of varying nature and magnitude and built a classifier to automatically detect messages that may contribute to situational awareness, utilizing a combination of hand-annotated and automatically-extracted linguistic features. Our system was able to achieve over 80\% accuracy on categorizing tweets that contribute to situational awareness. Additionally, we show that a classifier developed for a specific emergency event performs well on similar events. The results are promising, and have the potential to aid the general public in culling and analyzing information communicated during times of mass emergency.},

  abstract   = {In times of mass emergency, users of Twitter (a popular microblogging service) often communicate information about the event, some of which contributes to situational awareness. Situational awareness refers to a state of understanding the "big picture" in time- and safety-critical situations. The more situational awareness people have, the better equipped they are to make informed decisions. Given that hundreds of millions of Twitter communications (known as "tweets") are sent every day and emergency events regularly occur, automated methods are needed to identify those tweets that contain actionable, tactical information. The purpose of this dissertation is to explore how Twitter is used in mass emergencies, and to inform mechanisms for automatically identifying information that contributes to situational awareness. This dissertation provides a three-part analysis of Twitter communications from four different mass emergency situations. I first perform discourse analysis on tweet content to uncover and explain the information Twitter users communicate during mass emergencies. This analysis serves as the basis for a qualitative coding scheme of specific information types that lead to situational awareness. Second, using this coding scheme, tweets from each of the four emergency events are coded by multiple annotators and inter-annotator agreement rates are calculated. The results of this process provide an overview of the information Twitter users contribute in these emergency situations. My final analysis identifies linguistic characteristics of those tweets that convey situational awareness information and serves as a foundation for natural language processing classifiers that can be trained to identify such tweets. In sum, this dissertation contributes (1) an analysis of tweet content that is relevant to situational awareness, (2) an overview of the information Twitter users communicate that contributes to situational awareness, and (3) a computational linguistic resource for the development of natural language processing tools that automatically extract tweets containing information relevant to situational awareness.

This information could be valuable to emergency responders, but there remain challenges for using it to inform response efforts---including filtering relevant information from the large volumes of noise. Previous research has largely focused on identifying information that can contribute to a generalized concept of situational awareness. Our work explores the value of approaching this problem from a different perspective---one of actionablity---with the idea that information relevance may vary across responder role, domain, and other factors. This approach asks how we can get the right information to the right person at the right time? We interviewed and surveyed diverse responders to understand what "actionable" information is, allowing that actionability might differ from one responder to another. Through the findings, we (a) offer a nuanced understanding of actionability and differentiate it from situational awareness; (b) describe responders' perspective of what distinguishes good information when making rapid judgments; and (c) suggest opportunities for augmenting social media use to highlight information that needs immediate attention. We offer researchers an opportunity to frame different models of actionability to suit the requirements of a responding role.},

Information from bystanders and eyewitnesses can be useful for law enforcement agencies and humanitarian organizations to get firsthand and credible information about an ongoing situation to gain situational awareness among other potential uses. However, the identification of eyewitness reports on Twitter is a challenging task. This work investigates different types of sources on tweets related to eyewitnesses and classifies them into three types (i) direct eyewitnesses, (ii) indirect eyewitnesses, and (iii) vulnerable eyewitnesses. Moreover, we investigate various characteristics associated with each kind of eyewitness type. We observe that words related to perceptual senses (feeling, seeing, hearing) tend to be present in direct eyewitness messages, whereas emotions, thoughts, and prayers are more common in indirect witnesses. We use these characteristics and labeled data to train several machine learning classifiers. Our results performed on several real-world Twitter datasets reveal that textual features (bag-of-words) when combined with domain-expert features achieve better classification performance. Our approach contributes a successful example for combining crowdsourced and machine learning analysis, and increases our understanding and capability of identifying valuable eyewitness reports during disasters.},

As the use of Twitter to broadcast useful information during such situations becomes more widespread, the problem of finding it becomes more difficult. We describe an approach toward improving the recall in the sampling of Twitter communications that can lead to greater situational awareness during crisis situations. First, we create a lexicon of crisis-related terms that frequently appear in relevant messages posted during different types of crisis situations. Next, we demonstrate how we use the lexicon to automatically identify new terms that describe a given crisis. Finally, we explain how to efficiently query Twitter to extract crisis-related messages during emergency events. In our experiments, using a  crisis   lexicon  leads to substantial improvements in terms of recall when added to a set of crisis-specific keywords manually chosen by experts; it also helps to preserve the original distribution of message types.},

  abstract  = {Little has been done in the study of these intriguing questions, and I do not wish to give the impression that any extensive set of ideas exists that could be called a "theory." What is quite surprising, as far as the histories of science and philosophy are concerned, is that the major impetus for the fantastic growth of interest in brain processes, both psychological and physiological, has come from a device, a machine, the digital computer. In dealing with a human being and a human society, we enjoy the luxury of being irrational, illogical, inconsistent, and incomplete, and yet of coping. In operating a computer, we must meet the rigorous requirements for detailed instructions and absolute precision. If we understood the ability of the human mind to make effective decisions when confronted by complexity, uncertainty, and irrationality then we could use computers a million times more effectively than we do. Recognition of this fact has been a motivation for the spurt of research in the field of neurophysiology. The more we study the information processing aspects of the mind, the more perplexed and impressed we become. It will be a very long time before we understand these processes sufficiently to reproduce them. In any case, the mathematician sees hundreds and thousands of formidable new problems in dozens of blossoming areas, puzzles galore, and challenges to his heart's content. He may never resolve some of these, but he will never be bored. What more can he ask?},

Popular models that learn such representations ignore the morphology of words, by assigning a distinct vector to each word. This is a limitation, especially for languages with large vocabularies and many rare words. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on the skipgram model, where each word is represented as a bag of character n-grams. A vector representation is associated to each character n-gram; words being represented as the sum of these representations. Our method is fast, allowing to train models on large corpora quickly and allows us to compute word representations for words that did not appear in the training data. We evaluate our word representations on nine different languages, both on word similarity and analogy tasks. By comparing to recently proposed morphological word representations, we show that our vectors achieve state-of-the-art performance on these tasks.},

Our aim here is to contribute to this line of research focusing for the first time on French tweets related to ecological crises in order to support the French Civil Security and Crisis Management Department to provide immediate feedback on the expectations of the populations involved in the crisis. We propose a new dataset manually annotated according to three dimensions: relatedness, urgency and intentions to act. We then experiment with binary classification (useful vs. non useful), three-class (non useful vs. urgent vs. non urgent) and multiclass classification (i.e., intention to act categories) relying on traditional feature-based machine learning using both state of the art and new features. We also explore several deep learning models trained with pre-trained word embeddings as well as contextual embeddings. We then investigate three transfer learning strategies to adapt these models to the crisis domain. We finally experiment with multi-input architectures by incorporating different metadata extra-features to the network. Our deep models, evaluated in random sampling, out-of-event and out-of-type configurations, show very good performances outperforming several competitive baselines. Our results define the first contribution to the field of crisis management in French social media.},

For this purpose, social media serve as a timely information source due to its prevalence and high volume of first-hand accounts. While there are prior works on crises detection, many of them do not perform crisis embedding and classification using state-of-the-art attention-based deep neural networks models, such as Transformers and document-level contextual embeddings. In contrast, we propose CrisisBERT, an end-to-end transformer-based model for two crisis classification tasks, namely crisis detection and crisis recognition, which shows promising results across accuracy and F1 scores. The proposed CrisisBERT model demonstrates superior robustness over various benchmarks, and it includes only marginal performance compromise while extending from 6 to 36 events with a mere 51.4\% additional data points. We also propose Crisis2Vec, an attention-based, document-level contextual embedding architecture, for crisis embedding, which achieves better performance than conventional crisis embedding methods such as Word2Vec and GloVe.},

In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of "Canada" and "Air" cannot be easily combined to obtain "Air Canada". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.},

We analyze and make explicit the model properties needed for such regularities to emerge in word vectors. The result is a new global logbilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the two major model families in the literature: global matrix factorization and local context window methods. Our model efficiently leverages statistical information by training only on the nonzero elements in a word-word cooccurrence matrix, rather than on the entire sparse matrix or on individual context windows in a large corpus. The model produces a vector space with meaningful substructure, as evidenced by its performance of 75\% on a recent word analogy task.

This work presents CrisMap, a Big Data crisis mapping system capable of quickly collecting and analyzing social media data. CrisMap extracts potential crisis-related actionable information from tweets by adopting a classification technique based on word embeddings and by exploiting a combination of readily-available semantic annotators to geoparse tweets. The enriched tweets are then visualized in customizable, Web-based dashboards, also leveraging ad-hoc quantitative visualizations like choropleth maps. The maps produced by our system help to estimate the impact of the emergency in its early phases, to identify areas that have been severely struck, and to acquire a greater situational awareness. We extensively benchmark the performance of our system on two Italian natural disasters by validating our maps against authoritative data. Finally, we perform a qualitative case-study on a recent devastating earthquake occurred in Central Italy.},

Information that emanates from social media, especially in the early hours of a disaster when little-to-no information is available from other traditional sources, can be extremely valuable for emergency responders and decision makers to gain situational awareness and plan relief efforts. To capitalize on this potential, extensive research and development activities have been conducted over the last decade to build technologies to support various humanitarian aid tasks. In this paper, we provide an overview of the literature on using artificial intelligence and social media for disaster response and management from three perspectives: datasets, research studies, and systems. Then, we present further discussion on open research problems and future directions in the crisis informatics domain.},

  abstract  = {Making sense of a body of data is a common activity in any kind of analysis. Sensemaking is the process of searching for a representation and encoding data in that representation to answer task-specific questions. Different operations during sensemaking require different cognitive and external resources. Representations are chosen and changed to reduce the cost of operations in an information processing task. The power of these representational shifts is generally under-appreciated as is the relation between sensemaking and information retrieval.We analyze sensemaking tasks and develop a model of the cost structure of sensemaking. We discuss implications for the integrated design of user interfaces, representational tools, and information retrieval systems.},
