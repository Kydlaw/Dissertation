\chapter{Literature review}

\section*{Introduction}
This chapter presents and discusses the work related to the three research questions identified in the previous chapter.
The three research questions are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What can decision-relevant information from social media be processed automatically?
    \item How can the actionable information available on social be automatically retrieved during crisis response?
    \item What are the challenges faced by an information system dedicated to crisis management that embeds machine learning models?
\end{enumerate}

Each research question has its own section.
Each section presents the evolution of the associated fields and the trends that have guided their development.
The review of this literature allows for the identification of research directions for the next chapters.
The remainder of this section presents the methodology used for the literature review and the research hypotheses.

\subsection*{Methodology}
The approach adopted in this literature review is intermediate between a systematic approach and a survey of related works.
The justification for this singular approach is that many domains are presented, some containing several tens of thousands of articles.
For this reason, a systematic approach would be too cumbersome, while a survey would not reflect the richness of each field.

First, the scope of the literature review is defined through research hypotheses.
Once these hypotheses are created, queries are made on a bibliographic database.
The queries are performed on Scopus~\footnote{https://www.scopus.com/}, which offers a larger number of references than the Web of Science and more tools for query design.

The results obtained are then be analyzed from several angles.
First, the evolution of the volume of publications returned by the query to attempt to represent the interest in the topic.
Secondly, an analysis of the keywords is made through VOSviewer~\footnote{https://www.vosviewer.com/} "a software tool for constructing and visualizing bibliometric networks."
Especially VOSviewer allows visualizing bibliographic features such as the network of authors or of keywords.
The keywords used by the different articles fetched by request provide valuable insights into the evolution of a given field, especially its interdisciplinary aspect.
Finally, the results of the most cited articles are discussed.
This methodology aims to provide a sufficient understanding of the interest and evolution of the topics explored and answers related to the sub problematics exposed.

\subsection*{Hypotheses}
This manuscript is limited in the scientific domain investigated.
Thus, the following working hypotheses delimit the work presented.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item On social media data: social media data have a low ratio of information/noise and are as trustworthy as phone calls.
          Clean, well-written textual data are then excluded.
    \item On crisis management: the crisis management context is particular, and this manuscript focuses on the response phase and its context.
    \item On improving the decision-making process: improving decision-making means improving situational awareness and coordination among the various actors.
\end{enumerate}

Having these hypotheses, the literature review presented in this chapter explores the context around the different problematics raised in the previous chapter.
As a reminder, the primary research question is: \emph{How to design an information system for crisis response that can automatically manage and deliver actionable information from social media data?}
This main problem is decomposed among three sub problematics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item What information that can be obtained from social media is relevant to the decision-makers in crisis response?
    \item How can the information expected by the decision-makers be automatically retrieved, given the context of the crisis response?
    \item How is this information organized to deliver the value expected by decision-makers?
\end{itemize}

The first section of this chapter presents the work related to the main problem, especially systems developed to process social media during crisis response automatically.
Then, the second section explores the first sub problematic and the different representations of information used by previous work.
Finally, the third section overlooks social media processing by NLP in general to provide context for the second sub-problematic.
As the last sub problematic is similar to one of the main problematics, its literature review will be merged into the first section.

\section{Information systems for crisis response fed with social media data}
Chapter 1 identified the opportunities offered by social media to support crisis response.
Many researchers explored these opportunities and built systems and architectures to mine data and provide their insights to decision-makers.
This first part of the literature review intends to highlight the systems built for this purpose.
The question that this part aims to answer is: \emph{What are the existing social media processing system developed for crisis response over the years?}

The following request was run on the Scopus database to explore the previous question.

\begin{itemize}
    \item SUBJAREA(comp)
    \item AND (TITLE-ABS-KEY({crisis management} or {crisis response} or contingency or {disaster response} or {disaster management}))
    \item AND (TITLE-ABS-KEY ({social media} or twitter))
    \item AND (TITLE-ABS-KEY(system and processing))
    \item AND (EXCLUDE (DOCTYPE,"re") OR EXCLUDE (DOCTYPE,"cr"))
\end{itemize}

The request returns papers that:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Are in the computer science domain, which contains both the AI and Information Systems domains.
    \item Are centered around crises|disasters management|response or contingency plans.
    \item Present systems that process social media data.
    \item Papers that present conference tracks and reviews are excluded.
\end{itemize}

The request returns 96 documents published between 2011 and 2021.
The beginning of this domain of research corresponds to the democratization of social media, with the development of social media platforms happening during the 2000-2010 period (Figure~\ref{literature:crisis-informatic-hist}).
Naturally, the field has developed, driven by the need of crisis management organizations and the public interest benefit it promises.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/chap-2/crisis-informatic-hist.pdf}
    \caption{Timeline of the volume of contributions per years for the crisis informatic domain. The year 2021 is excluded because the year is not complete at the time of writing.}
    \label{literature:crisis-informatic-hist}
\end{figure}

The network provided by VOSviewer (Figure~\ref{literature:crisis-informatic-overlay}) does not reveal any significant cluster of keywords, which is not surprising considering the youth of the domain.
However, the timeline of publication (represented by the color variation) provides interesting insight into the direction of the domain.
Years around 2016 were mostly focused on data analyses of the different datasets available.
Then, the following years saw the development of more and more automation.
Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing appeared in that chronological order, coinciding with the progress made in these areas.
More recently, deep learning models to process text and images are appearing, as well as new opportunities created by the internet of things and the development of the concept of smart cities.
It is also very interesting to observe that social sciences and computers sciences are completely blended all together.

    \end{figure}
\end{landscape}

The bar diagram (Figure~\ref{literature:crisis-informatic-bar}) provides a better representation of the distribution of the occurrences of the different keywords.
From the most common ones, two areas of interest seem to emerge.
The automatic processing of the data, mostly textual according to the use of \emph{natural language processing} and \emph{text processing} is no more important than the use of this automation.
\emph{Disaster prevention}, \emph{situation awareness}, \emph{information management} and \emph{emergency services} highlight the importance of the applications of the results.

\end{figure}

As mentioned in the first chapter, automatically processing the content of social media to extract information is a new and promising scientific venue.
Thus, many attempted to create systems to achieve this goal, proposing features to improve systems' usability.
Overview of the different attempts and their feature to identify what has been done in this area.
Table~\ref{table:crisis-informatic-main-articles} presents the results of the previous query that mention a processing system that uses social media as a data source and that has been cited at least ten times are shown.
From these main systems were extracted the main features presented by their authors.

Among the features identified, the trend towards automation observed earlier is still clear.
The first works present systems that use crowdsourcing to identify relevant information from messages posted on social media
\parencite{schulzCrisisInformationManagement2012, backfriedOpenSourceIntelligence2012,imranAIDRArtificialIntelligence2014}.
The following works were interested in automating the previous tasks, presumably to reduce the dependence on human actors and to improve the processing of the important amount of data.
Problems related to the detection of occurence of events and their related information on social media, have been explored using different approaches \parencite{imranAIDRArtificialIntelligence2014,middletonRealtimeCrisisMapping2014,avvenutiEARSEarthquakeAlert2014, gibsonCombiningBigSocial2014}.
In parallel, experiments were conducted to identify the best ways to organize and disseminate the information obtained \parencite{middletonRealtimeCrisisMapping2014,huangDisasterMapperCyberGISFramework2015,avvenutiPullingInformationSocial2016,grunder-fahrerTopicsTopicalPhases2018}.
Building on its successes, the field has continued to develop by relying on other available data formats and in particular images \parencite{alamImage4ActOnlineSocial2017,nguyenAutomaticImageFiltering2017,agarwalCrisisDIASMultimodalDamage2020}.
Beyond the data, new questions have emerged, following feedback from the emergency departments involved in the experiments.
The detection of sub-events and of the different concerns of the impacted population is added to the results of previous works \parencite{wuStreamExplorerMultiStageSystem2018,raginiBigDataAnalytics2018,grunder-fahrerTopicsTopicalPhases2018}.
More recently, teams with a broader vision are interested in the integration of such systems within the connected city \parencite{shahDisasterResilientSmart2019}.
The multiplication of sources and formats naturally leads to the need for unified processing methods for data and fusion of information obtained by the different channels \parencite{alamDescriptiveVisualSummaries2020}.

This introductory section presented previous works around crisis informatics.
More particularly, it highlighted the development of the field over time.
This is directly reflected in the different systems developed and their features.
An interesting trend to note is the move towards more and more automation in systems.
First, using crowdsourcing for initial data labeling, the following systems used machine learning to classify the data into different categories.
Later, automation was further extended to other valuable data types and ways to merge the information acquired.

\section{Decision-making in crisis situation}
This part of the literature review explores the bibliographic context around the first sub problematic: What information that can be obtained from social media is relevant to the decision-makers in crisis response?
Specifically, its looks at answers to the question: \emph{what is the decision-making context in emergencies?}

Decision-making is at the heart of the response during a disaster.
Ideally, the right decisions need to be made at the right time.
This expectation is unrealistic, but it is best to understand first
: (i) the previous attempts to understand the word of decisions makers and
(ii) what hinders them in the performance of their tasks and their main pains?

\subsection{Organization of information during crises: crisis situation models}
\label{sec:lit-information-models}
Crisis management is as ancient as crises themselves.
Thus, many tackled the problems in this area.
With the advent of computers to delegate tasks, many have thought of delegating some of the crisis management to machines.
However, managing this information requires at first building representations (or abstractions) of crises for computers.
Consequently, ontologies and information models emerged to represent the informational concepts manipulated during an emergency situation.
This sub-section aims at retrieving from the literature the different key informational concepts useful for decision-makers during crisis response.

The request run on Scopus is as follow:
\begin{itemize}
    \item SUBJAREA(comp)
    \item AND (TITLE-ABS-KEY ({crisis management} or {crisis response} or {disaster management} or contingency or {disaster response}))
    \item AND (TITLE-ABS-KEY (ontology or metamodel))
    \item AND (EXCLUDE (DOCTYPE,"re") OR EXCLUDE (DOCTYPE,"cr"))
\end{itemize}

The request returns papers that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Are in the computer science domain, as this domain contains both the AI and Information Systems domains.
    \item Are centered around crises|disasters management|response or contingency plans.
    \item That present systems that process data
    \item Papers that present conference tracks and reviews are excluded.
\end{itemize}

The request returns 205 documents published between 1998 and 2021.
Figure~\ref{literature:situation-models-hist} shows the evolution of the volume of publication between 1998 and 2020.
The field has emerged around 2000 and built momentum for ten years to reach a plateau of fifteen articles on average per year.
The domain was developed in order to organize the data, information, and knowledge present during crisis events.
To achieve this goal, representations of the different concepts involved during such events were needed.
Two paths to represent these concepts have been taken: ontologies and metamodels.
Ontologies and metamodels are very close concepts.
Both methods aim at creating a controlled vocabulary to define the entities and their relations in a given domain.
The difference between the two methods happens in the grammar used for the vocabulary.
Metamodels usually use a formal and common grammar (a modelization language such as UML) to ease the distribution and development of these representations.
As the backbone of model-driven engineering, Metamodels tend to be developed with interoperability between different systems in mind.
Thus the use of common tools to represent concepts between the engineers.
Ontologies, on the other hand, use their grammar for the entities that it defines.
As mentioned in the first chapter, crises are a broad concept, and creating ontologies or metamodels of crises is a very challenging task.
Thus, many ontologies and metamodels have been created to represent different aspects of crisis management.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/chap-2/situation-models-hist.pdf}
    \caption{Timeline of the volume of contributions per years for the crisis-situation models domain. The year 2021 is excluded because the year is not complete at the time of writing.}
    \label{literature:situation-models-hist}
\end{figure}

Following the same methodology as in the previous section, Figure~\ref{literature:situation-models-overlay} provides a visual of the evolution over time of the different keywords used in the fetched articles.
The overlay indicates three clusters: a major one and two smaller ones.
One is related to genes, and the other one is related to supply chains and infrastructures.
The one related to genes is a cluster of outliers, composed of 7 articles from the medical field.
The second cluster is also composed of a few articles centered around ontologies for the petroleum sector.
The main cluster, however, is more centered on the topic of this literature review.
As in the previous section, the evolution (represented by the color variation) of the keywords hint at the direction of the domain over time.

\begin{landscape}
    \begin{figure}[htb]
        \includegraphics[width=\paperwidth,height=\paperheight,keepaspectratio]{figures/chap-2/situation-models-overlay.pdf}
        \caption{Distribution of keywords with more than 3 occurrences among the articles from the query on crisis-situation models.}
        \label{literature:situation-models-overlay}
    \end{figure}
\end{landscape}

Unlike the query, the overlay spans from 2010 to 2016.
This is because the overlay does not include all keywords but only those that appear in at least three different articles.
By cross-checking this information with the previous histogram, one understands the reason for this short period.
For many years the number of publications was relatively low and apparently without any real consensus among the keywords.
If this is understandable at the beginning of a field, this explanation does not explain the stop of the overlay from 2016.
However, using the histogram again, the domain loses popularity from 2015 onwards to return to its previous level around 2018.
It is possible to hypothesize that it is this loss of interest that has led to the result observed on the overlay.

Despite this short covered span, it is possible to identify keywords use trends similar to those in crisis informatics.
The older keywords used, such as "SOA," "simulation," "multi-agent systems," and "systems engineering," show an interest centered around the core of what we're used ontologies and metamodels for—model-driven engineering and information management.
Then, the field knew a pic of interest, as the previous histogram showed.
This period reflects on Figure~\ref{literature:situation-models-bar}, where one can observe that most of the most important keywords are located between 2012 and 2014.
As explained previously, the years between 2021 and 2014 were indeed the most prolific.
These years were primarily focused on the idea of crisis management systems powered by artificial intelligence for decision support.
Artificial intelligence would automatically create the information representations needed by systems.
As these representations would have been written in a standard way, these systems would have adapted to new models, providing greater interoperability quickly.
After this period, the interest in the field decreases a few before coming back with new approaches.
Knowledge-based systems and knowledge management started to appear and a reborn of metamodel and ontologies creation, powered by improvements in machine learning.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/chap-2/situation-models-bar.pdf}
    \caption{Distribution of keywords with more than 4 occurrences among the articles from the query on crisis-situation models.}
    \label{literature:situation-models-bar}
\end{figure}

In association with the previous qualitative review of the field, Table~\ref{table:situation-models-main-articles} presents the needs of the decision-maker identified in the articles from the previous request with at least 25 citations.
Duplicates and unrelated articles (e.g., gene ontologies) are also excluded.
This review of the main articles highlights the diversity of approaches covered by ontologies and metamodels.
Some of these ontologies are specific to certain events \parencite{xuModelingRepresentationEarthquake2014,qiuIntegratedFloodManagement2017,jungOntologydrivenSlopeModeling2015}.
While these models effectively deal with the event they are designed for, most of their concept representations do not fit with other kinds of events.

As presented in the introductory chapter, collaboration between the actors is a matter of interest for crisis management organizations.
Thus \textcite{benabenMetamodelItsOntology2008b} and \textcite{othmanDevelopmentValidationDisaster2014} propose metamodels to represent the collaboration between several actors, independantly of the type of crisis.
The metamodel proposed by \citeauthor{benabenMetamodelItsOntology2008b} is further developed in section~\hyperref[sec:crisismetamodel]{3.2.1.}

Others have also focused on emergency organizations and proposed ways to improve their functioning.
\textcite{chouOntologyDevelopingWeb2011} proposed a way to automatically create websites to disseminate information related to an ongoing event.
As reports are an essential concern and participate in information overload, \textcite{liOntologyenrichedMultiDocumentSummarization2010} created an ontology to assist in report summarization.
Disaster management software is inherently complex. Thus, \textcite{babitskiSoKNOSUsingSemantic2011} proposed an ontology to assist in their development and another to assess their functionalities.
As disaster management systems grow, they become intricated and complex. \textcite{madniSystemsIntegrationKey2014} proposed an ontology to facilitate their integration into a functioning system of systems.

All the systems mentioned above require data.
Fortunately, sensors are excellent ways to keep emergency responders informed of specific characteristics of their environment.
\textcite{posladSemanticIoTEarly2015} and \textcite{babitskiOntologybasedIntegrationSensor2009} proposed ontologies to better integrate sensors data into crisis cells.
Finally, another type of sensor considered is humans, acting as social sensors whose data can be automatically gathered from social media platforms.
\textcite{purohitIdentifyingSeekersSuppliers2014} proposed an ontology to identify victims' requests and volunteers' capabilities from tweets.
As being able to geolocate the individual behind a post allows better actionability for emergency services, \textcite{ghahremanlouGeotaggingTwitterMessages2014} built an ontology to help solve this issue.

This part identified the different approaches to model information in crisis response from a decision-maker point of view.
Yet, most of these approaches are top-down, and few conducted interviews to identify decision-makers needs directly.
The next section looks at articles in the literature that used a bottom-up approach to identify the aforementioned needs.

\subsection{Business needs of emergency services}
Emergency management teams are tasked with novel and complex decisions.
Information collection is one of the levers that ease decision-making and, therefore,
facilitate crisis management.
Knowing what are the different elements that hinder emergency management teams from
achieving their goals and what could ease information gathering is of the utmost importance to improve crisis management.
Researchers in social sciences have been interested in the study of these pain points.
This section aims to highlight the main issues identified in the literature.

The executed request is:

\begin{itemize}
    \item TITLE-ABS-KEY({information gathering} or interview?)
    \item AND TITLE-ABS-KEY({emergency responders} or {Emergency services} or {dispatchers})

    \item AND (EXCLUDE(DOCTYPE,"re") OR EXCLUDE(DOCTYPE,"cr"))
\end{itemize}

It aims at obtaining articles that:

    \item Mention information gathering or interview in their content and mention emergency responders, dispatchers or emergency services.
    \item Are linked to social sciences, computer sciences, or decision sciences.
    \item Papers that present conference tracks and reviews are excluded.
\end{itemize}

The request returns 219 documents published between 1995 and 2021.
The area follows an increasing trend similar to the other two previous areas.
Interest in the study of emergency services has been growing rapidly since the 2000s.
This interest grew relatively steadily until today, where about 20 articles are published per year on the subject (Figure~\ref{literature:business-needs-hist}).

\end{figure}

The overlay of the keywords generated from the articles retrieved (Figure~\ref{literature:business-needs-overlay}) spans from 2010 to 2018.
It reveals two clusters: one centered on medical issues and another one centered on information systems.
The medical cluster is mainly focused on the well-being of the personnel in charge of the emergency and, in particular, in their psychological health.
The other cluster is more focused on the information systems of emergency services and events management.
This last one is more in connection with the objective of this manuscript; the next analysis will be focused on it.

        \label{literature:business-needs-overlay}
    \end{figure}
\end{landscape}

The left cluster is composed of the most common keywords used in the fetched articles.
Keywords such as \emph{disaster}, \emph{information systems} and \emph{risk management} (Figure~\ref{literature:business-needs-bar}) are the most prominent ones and seems to be mostly used circa 2014.
Prior to that period (between 2010 and 2014), the field was mostly focusing on resource or training planning.
But the field took a shift towards data processing to support \emph{decision-making} during emergency events.
The collision with the other domains explored in this chapter seems to happen around 2018, and we're keywords such as \emph{machine learning}, \emph{social media} or \emph{situational awareness}.

Table~\ref{table:business-needs-main-articles} provides a summary of the responder's needs identified in the most prominent articles in the field.
Articles were selected if they had at least 25 citations were published in 2010 or after, are located in the information systems cluster, and are not duplicates.
The articles retrieved provide insights on what are some of the pain points of emergency organizations.

Some studies are event-specific due to a governmental request or a gap in the emergency preparation cover.
\textcite{lindellTsunamiPreparednessOregon2010} is interested in tsunamis management on the US east coast and \textcite{cabreraaguileraModellingPerformanceVariabilities2016} tackle oil spill.
Both studies do not address any particular point in the management of this type of event.
Rather, they implement the entire crisis management cycle for these events, which were not considered until their work.
Unfortunately, no specific information needed for decision-makers emerges.

On the other hand, others articles are most focused on the specific needs of emergency organizations.
Collaboration, information sharing and joint preparation exercises are one of the concerns raised \parencite{berlinWhyCollaborationMinimised2011,parkerSurfaceWaterFlood2011}.
The increasing complexity of crisis events asks for a wider range of skills.
As no organization can possess all the required skills at the same time, other actors have to be involved.
Crisis management organizations acknowledge that an unexpected collaboration between actors yields poor outcomes during the response.
Thus, exercises and discussions are key during the preparation phase, and an adequate means of communication between the actors during the response are needs identified by the studies.

\textcite{yangDesignPrinciplesIntegrated2012} highlight an interesting and well-mentioned need for crisis response: situation awareness.
Situation awareness corresponds to the representation of the state of the environment that surrounds the emergency response organization during an event.
This representation directly guides decision-making.
Consequently, building the best and most accurate representation possible directly at the start of the event is critical.
In there are articles, \citeauthor{yangDesignPrinciplesIntegrated2012} emphasize 4 critical pieces of information for situational awareness:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Environmental conditions such as the building infrastructure, number of occupants, and the exact location of any hazards;
    \item Information on the response participants such as who is involved in the response, what skills they could offer, and what resources they bring to the scene;
    \item The status of any casualties, the accident location, cause, and severity; and
    \item The available resources, including equipment and food.
\end{enumerate}

As per the authors, "timeliness, accuracy, and completeness are the critical dynamic attributes of these four categories of information."
The next chapter (chapter three) will dive deeper into this concept.

The issue with building an accurate situation awareness is the need for information.
With the disruption of the regular means of communication and information channels, decision-makers are shrouded in darkness.
According to \textcite{tapiaTrustworthyTweetDeeper2013,cobbDesigningDelugeUnderstanding2014}, some emergency centers acknowledge the benefit of social media as a potential information source.
However, the issue identified is the lack of tools and methods, similar to the ones that were built for calls for social media.

Finally, the last need identified among the extracted items is communication to the public.
\textcite{aloudatRegulationUbiquitousMobile2011} insist on the potential yielded by modern communication means such as cell phones and social media to share information with the public during an event.
As people are not always around a radio or a TV, they often miss critical messages during fast-moving events (floods, fires, etc.), resulting in casualties.
On the other hand, (almost literally) most of the population carry a cellphone nowadays, and the critical messages could be distributed faster and with a better viewing rate than traditional methods.
Text messages or notifications from social media could be more effective communication channels that emergency response teams should use.

\subsection{Information gathering: the place of social media?}
% TODO Developper l'analyse de cette partie qui est trop courte comparée au reste.
% TODO 1. Lire les articles pour en extraire le contenu et le lier à ce qui a été fait précédement. 
Looking back at the first chapter, the sub problematic linked to this section was: \emph{What information that can be obtained from social media is relevant to the decision-makers in crisis response?}
The two previous subsections identified several references that explored the pain points of decision-makers in crisis management.
Each sub-section respectively explored top-down and bottom-up approaches to crisis management understanding.
However, social media were not directly considered in the query made on the bibliographic database as social media are not the only concern of these fields.

This sub-section emphasizes the intersection of the previous results and social media.
Crisis situation models:
Among the 205 documents on crisis models, 22 articles include the keywords \emph{social media} or \emph{Twitter} to the query.
Two articles from the list of articles qualified as prominent are centered on social media:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textcite{purohitIdentifyingSeekersSuppliers2014}
    \item \textcite{ghahremanlouGeotaggingTwitterMessages2014}
\end{itemize}

The same approach applied to the needs of crisis management organizations provides a similar number of articles.
22 articles among the 219 mention \emph{social media} or \emph{twitter}.
Among the articles studied in the previous part, two are dedicated to social media:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textcite{cobbDesigningDelugeUnderstanding2014}
    \item \textcite{tapiaTrustworthyTweetDeeper2013}
\end{itemize}

In both cases, only roughly 10\% of the total body of surveys mention social media.
% From the remaining articles, most of the ontologies or metamodels are studied and represent information flows during an event.
% For instance, \textcite{montarnalAutomatedEmergenceCrisis2017} create an ontology to merge data coming from social media and sensors.
% \textcite{gaurEmpathiOntologyEmergency2019} followed up by adding satellites images.
% It appears that the information available during the event and the management of the same event are too different to get associated in the same representation.
% Despite this explanation, very few link the two to create a representation of emergency management mindful of the information available.

\subsection*{Conclusion}
This section answered the question: \emph{What is the decision-making context in emergencies?}
This issue has attracted a fair amount of attention, and this section explored two ways taken by two research communities to answer this question.
These two ways correspond to the two subsections.
The first sub-section was dedicated to model engineering and the previous attempts to create representations
or abstractions to represent the concepts involved in an emergency.
This approach is fed by the need to automate certain tasks in crisis management, hence the need for concepts to represent and manage the different aspects.
However, this approach is essentially top-down, and few references report feedbacks from field interviews.

This insight feeds the need to gather the information requirements of the primary users during their operations.
Hence, the second sub-section, dedicated to the report of the problems that crisis management organizations face, gathered through interviews.
Yet, this bottom-up approach produces unstructured results, which cannot be directly translated with an automatic

Overall, the needs identified to improve crisis management from both approaches' outcomes are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Situation Awareness
    \item Collaboration
    \item Communication to the public
    \item Social media accounting
    \item Sensor data integration
    \item Large data volume processing
\end{itemize}

The next section will discuss the existing means of identifying and mining information from social media.

\section{NLP tools for information extraction from social media data}
The first chapter presented the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain.
Through the development of this domain, many tools, algorithms, and methods have been developed to process textual data.
With the emergence of social media, a new source of textual data appeared, and with it, its own challenges.

This chapter explores the research question: \emph{How can this information be obtained in the context of crisis informatics?}
Social media data are used as a data source in various use cases.
This section is broken down into two parts, and it aims to explore two directions.
First, for which applications natural language processing is used on social media data?
Secondly, how is this information extracted?
Each direction has its own dedicated sub-section.

To explored these two direction the following request is run:

\begin{itemize}
    \item (TITLE-ABS-KEY({natural language processing} or {information mining}))
    \item AND (TITLE-ABS-KEY({social media} or Twitter))
    \item AND (TITLE-ABS-KEY(survey))
    \item AND (EXCLUDE(DOCTYPE, "re") OR EXCLUDE(DOCTYPE, "cr"))
\end{itemize}

The idea behind this request is as follow:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use "natural language processing" or "information mining" as a keyword.
    \item In addition to the previous ones, they also have to include "social media" or "Twitter."
    \item This request only retrieves surveys.
    \item It excludes articles that present conference tracks and or reviews of other articles.
\end{itemize}

% TODO Mieux justifier cette partie.
% ? En retirant le mot cle survey, la requete retourne 4231 documents sur la période
% ? Cet important volume de publication, qui reflète l'engouement pour cette venue, rend difficile l'analyse de l'évolution du domaine.
% ? Le choix est donc fait d'analyser les différentes surveys.
Contrary to other sections, this one will take surveys as a proxy to study the domain.
Without the constraint put on surveys, the request returns 4231 documents.
As this publication volume could not be processed in a reasonable amount of time, the choice has been to look only at surveys.
However, this hypothesis seems reasonable, considering the fact that the goal is to identify the main trends in the field.

The request returns 217 surveys, published between 2011 and 2021 (Figure~\ref{literature:nlp-hist}).
While being a fairly recent research venue, the interest in NLP uses on social media data is really high and increased over the years.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/chap-2/nlp-hist.pdf}
    \caption{Timeline of the volume of contributions per years for the application of NLP methods to social media data. The year 2021 is excluded because the year is not complete at the time of writing.}
    \label{literature:nlp-hist}
\end{figure}

The surveys retrieved appear as a single cluster (Figure~\ref{literature:nlp-overlay}).
This overlay was created by aggregating synonyms, removing the keywords from the query, and some keywords with a low value for our study ("state of the art, large amounts, codes (symbols), research questions, text").
Despite the field's youth, its evolution is swift, both in applications and methods used.
Circa 2011, the field was essentially centered around epidemiological applications and statistical analyses.
From this point on, a kaleidoscope of applications and methods was used.
They are detailed in the next two subsections.

\begin{landscape}
    \begin{figure}[htb]
        \includegraphics[width=\paperwidth,height=\paperheight,keepaspectratio]{figures/chap-2/nlp-overlay.pdf}
        \caption{Distribution of keywords with more than 3 occurrences among the articles from the query on NLP applied on social media data.}
        \label{literature:nlp-overlay}
    \end{figure}
\end{landscape}

However, from these years, some trends have been more prominent than others.
On the application side, \emph{sentiment analyses} is by far the most studied application (73 mentions of this keyword) (Figure~\ref{literature:nlp-bar}).
Mining applications are second with \emph{data mining} (mentioned 61 times), \emph{text mining} (30 times) and \emph{opinion mining} (mentioned 21 times).
On the method side, \emph{artificial intelligence} (mentioned 25 times), and especially \emph{machine learning} (85 times, almost half surveys) methods (such as \emph{deep learning}) are heavily mentioned as well in the surveys.
This probably comes from the parallel advances made in NLP through the renew of machine learning.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/chap-2/nlp-bar.pdf}
    \caption{Distribution of keywords with more than 4 occurrences among the articles from the query on NLP applied on social media data.}
    \label{literature:nlp-bar}
\end{figure}

The next sub-section explores the application mentioned by the surveys obtained from the request.

\subsection{Social media information extracted using NLP}
Social media data contain valuable information for a wide range of applications.
The surveys fetched contain several application domains in their keywords.
They are summarized in Table~\ref{table:application-domains}.
Some of the keywords are grouped to reflect the significant domain they depend on.
Also, some keywords were common to multiple topics.
For instance, \emph{attitude} is used both in health and business-related surveys.
\emph{quality of life} is used in urban issues, breast cancers, depression detection, and opioid side effects.
Other keywords that did not belong to any major category have been grouped in a separate category.

Thus, there are seven major domains identified:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Epidemiology
    \item Medical Informatic
    \item Behavioral Research
    \item Social Media Research
    \item Business
    \item Information Science
    \item NLP Challenges
\end{itemize}

NLP applied to social media is used for a variety of medical applications.
Epidemiology, which studies the distribution and frequency of diseases as everyone knows by now,
is interested in social media to monitor the mention of symptoms by users in order to detect and observe the spread of disease.
This includes, of course, the COVID-19 outbreak of the influenza outbreak in (2009-2010).
Broader medical applications are labeled under "Medical Informatics."
It contains applications using the same methodology but applied to other diseases or conditions, such as \emph{depression}, \emph{obesity} or \emph{pregnancy}.
Social media are also considered for \emph{pharmacovigilance} to monitor secondary effects (\emph{patient satisfaction}, \emph{opiate addiction}).
The behavior of the urban population (\emph{smartcity}, \emph{computer crime}) or society in general (\emph{demography}, \emph{population surveillance}) can also be observed through social media.
Their expressed feelings towards events or political decisions can then be quantified and analyzed.
As digital twins of society, social media are also environments that bring some reflections of their own.
The phenomenon of \emph{fake news} in particular has taken many actors in society by surprise and is an issue that attracts a lot of attention.
How information spreads within the \emph{social network} of users or its very structure are also topics of research.
Marketing departments and PR firms are also naturally very interested in the insights available on social media.
The management of the content of social media and especially the \emph{information extraction} and \emph{knowledge extraction} part
are challenges for the information science domain.
Social media data also come with their own challenges for the NLP domain.
Social media content is noisy, informal, and often comes with its own use of grammar.
Consequently, most of the methods applied to other texts are disrupted with social media data.
\emph{machine translation}, \emph{named entity recognition} and other tasks are then explored and improved in this context.
Alongside improvements on several tasks, social media are also widely used to \emph{sentiment analysis}, \emph{topic modeling} or \emph{polarity classification}.
In the final category, interesting topics appear, such as \emph{crowdsourcing}.
Indeed, instead of exploiting social media, some social scientists leverage their power to achieve goals and then study mechanisms that can encourage positive actions.
Of course, \emph{climate change} is also an application mentioned, considering the importance of this topic.

\subsection{NLP's tools to process previous data}
The previous sub-section presented the different applications of NLP on social media data.
The surveys retrieved also mentioned algorithms, methods, or models related to NLP.
This sub-section aims to present the different methods mentioned briefly.
Table~\ref{table:nlp-tools} shows the keywords used in the surveys and groups them according to the different fields of artificial intelligence to which they belong.

The many applications above require many different algorithms capable of meeting different needs.
As already mentioned, data from social media are particular compared to the usual corpus composed of books and national newspapers.
This particularity, combined with the specificities of textual data, can be found through keywords such as \emph{Pre-processing}, \emph{feature extraction} or \emph{N-gram modeling}.
Pre-processing refers to the different steps that clean/prepare the data before they are passed to the algorithm.
N-gram modeling is one of the possible steps and consists of grouping the tokens of a sentence into groups of N tokens.

The data are then provided to the processing algorithms.
Most of the algorithms mentioned in the survey are machine learning algorithms.
These algorithms build \emph{statistical models} based on the distribution of tokens in sentences to provide results.
There are different categories of algorithms for different use cases.
\emph{Classification algorithms} are algorithms designed to assign data to a category.
On the other hand, \emph{regression} algorithms provide a value in a numerical range.
These models can be either \emph{classifiers} or regression models.
Most of these models are \emph{supervised} meaning that they require a dataset where all the data are annotated with a label.
Models can also be semi-supervised (only a portion is annotated) or self-supervised (the model learns its own label from scratch).
Neural networks are also machine learning algorithms and can be stacked in layers to build deep neural networks able to learn complex and abstract patterns.

More specifically, many algorithms are also cited. Their functioning will not be detailed, only their applications and the potential reasons for their mention in the surveys.
The \emph{K-Nearest Neighbors}, as its name suggests, it uses the features present in the data to identify the K closest points to a given point.
It can be used to identify the most similar messages in a corpus.
\emph{Decision trees}, and its ensemble version \emph{random forests}, are classifiers/regressors algorithms that build decision paths to classify the incoming data.
\emph{Support Vector Machine} (or SVM) achieves the same result by building a decision boundary between the different sets of data using a kernel chosen by the user.
The boundaries created by SVM are usually more subtle than the ones created by decision trees, resulting in better results in complex datasets.
These models are used for applications such as sentiment, polarity, attitude, or opinion analysis but also for language identification.
The \emph{Latent Dirichlet Allocation} algorithm allows to identify the topic in a collection of documents and is thus used in topic modeling.

Deep \emph{neural network} models are used for applications that rely on the semantics of words rather than their distribution.
\emph{Convolutional neural networks} are a specific type of neural network composed of neurons that use a kernel, or convolution matrix, to detect patterns in sentences.
These neural networks are used for classification applications.
\emph{Recurrent Neural Networks} are another type of neural network that uses a recurrent structure.
It uses specific neurons that are able to handle information coming forward and backward.
These neural networks are also used for classification applications, but also machine translation or named entities recognition.
Finally, once these models are trained, it is possible to reuse their knowledge for other applications.
\emph{Transfer learning} consists in reusing a model trained on a task to solve similar ones, completely re-training a model from scratch.

Social media processing applications have widely benefited from recent improvements in machine learning.
This trend is visible in how this field evolved over time towards statistical models and later deep neural networks.
As applications are numerous and opportunities offered by the NLP domain significant, the two meet in the middle, and several research teams explore the different paths offered.
The surveys retrieved provided valuable insights to answer the original problem of this section: \emph{How can this information be obtained in the context of crisis informatics?}
The results are twofold.

The first sub-section identified the main applications of NLP on social media data.
Most of the applications identified rely on one or more of the following information:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Language used
    \item Medical symptoms
    \item Named entities
    \item Topic of a message
    \item Truthfulness
    \item Location
    \item Opinions
    \item Sentiments
    \item Attitude
    \item Polarity
\end{itemize}

The second sub-section reviewed the most prominent algorithms used to process social media data and linked them to the applications previously identified.
Thus, there are many ways to extract the previous information from social media data.
The choice of the algorithm then depends on several parameters such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Desired information;
    \item Volume of training data available;
    \item Computational resources available; or
    \item Prediction accuracy.
\end{itemize}

Crisis management also comes with its own constraints that need to be considered when designing a social media processing system.

\section{Literature review outcomes}
This chapter explored the literature around the main problem of this manuscript:
\emph{How to design an information system able to automatically manage and deliver relevant information extracted from social media data during crisis response?}
For this purpose, the literature review was articulated around three main research axes:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Axis 1 explored the main social media processing systems for crisis management previously developed.
          Many systems have been developed on this occasion, with a trend towards increasing automation, data collection and processing.
          Also, many different issues have been addressed (different types of crises, different types of data, etc.), often with different approaches proposed.
          The most recent advances are focused on more and more sophisticated data processing (images, the fusion of information obtained, etc.).
          However, these systems focus on succinctly described problems, leaving many unanswered questions as to the problem addressed.
    \item The second axis of research was interested in the needs in identified information to which the preceding systems are supposed to answer.
          Two points of view were confronted on this occasion: (i) the top-down vision of the modelers who tried to represent and organize the information exchanged during an event between different actors and
          (ii) the bottom-up approach of the sociologists, who sought to collect through interviews the information needs of the actors in charge during a crisis.
          Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. The first one organizes the information in a computerized model but does not consider the real need.
          The second approach, on the contrary, collects the needs expressed by the first concerned but rarely proposes a result that can be exploited by computers.
          However, both points of view agree on the importance of the issue of information management in crisis management.
    \item Finally, the third axis explored previous work that has automatically textual exploited data from social media using NLP.
          The different applications have been summarized, both from the point of view of the application domain and the problem that the approach allowed to solve.
          This was also an opportunity to review the main algorithms mentioned in the articles obtained and to correlate them with the problems.
          Many of the current approaches rely on supervised machine learning, which consists of training an algorithm to perform a specific task by providing it with labeled data.
          This approach has some limitations, which will be further developed in chapter 4.
          This axis allowed to highlight the possibilities offered by the richness of the data available on social media.
\end{enumerate}

Table~\ref{table:lit-review-summary} summarizes the results of this literature review.
It cross-references the identified information needs with the available social media information previously mined.
The table ignores three of the information needs identified at the end of Section 2.
By considering only the information available on social media, the consideration of social media content becomes implicit.
Social media information is, to my knowledge, most of the time, isolated from the information delivered by physical sensors.
The integration of data from these sensors is, therefore, outside our scope.
Finally, social media deliver by nature large volumes of data.
This need is therefore implicitly considered when considering social media due to the very nature of these platforms.
The remaining needs are, therefore:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Collaboration: the need for information to support coordination between partners
    \item Situational awareness: the need for information that enables the identification of the elements that make up the environment
    \item Public communication: the need for information to understand the population's feelings regarding the event and facilitate public relations.
\end{itemize}

An interesting point to note is that not all needs are on the same level.
For instance, social media accounting and sensor data integration provide data that contribute to situational awareness and consequently ease the collaboration between the different actors.

This chapter highlighted past achievements in the field of crisis informatics.
One interesting trend to note is the convergence of all the fields studied.
It also revealed the steps that are still ahead and the unresolved issues.
In particular, it was pointed out that previous systems did not systematically build on existing work on information needs assessment.
Chapter 3, therefore, addresses this aspect and focuses on this need and its computational modeling.
The next chapter is also the occasion to emphasize the interdisciplinary discussions which took place during this research, conducted at the border between sociology and computer science.
